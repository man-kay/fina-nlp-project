AAL,2022,1,"Good morning, and welcome to the American Airlines Group first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] And now I'd like to turn the conference over to your moderator, head of investor relations, Mr. Scott Long.
Now, before we begin today, I must state that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues, costs, forecast of capacity and fleet plans. These statements represent our predictions and expectations of future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release that was issued this morning, as well as our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. In addition, we'll be discussing several non-GAAP financial measures this morning, which exclude the impact of unusual items.
For the year ahead, we are resolute in achieving two key goals above all else, running a reliable operation and returning to profitability. Our team is up to the challenge, and we've already seen a lot of great progress. So let's talk about financials first. This morning, America reported a first quarter GAAP net loss of $1.6 billion.
Turning to reliability. American ended 2021 with our strongest operating performance in the company's history. We're committed to maintaining that momentum in the first quarter, and we did. Despite two difficult winter storms in Dallas/Fort Worth, the team delivered a solid operating performance in the first quarter, leading the industry in on-time departures and finishing a close second at on-time arrivals.
And we will continue to aggressively recruit, hire and train across all departments to develop the best pipeline of talent in the industry. We're ready for the summer, and we have sized the airline for the resources we have available. Again, we sized the airline for the resources that we have available. We've also made targeted investments in people, technology and resources that are yielding promising results for our team members and customers.
So before I hand it over to Derek, I want to say that I'm really excited about the future of our industry and the future of American Airlines. There's still a lot of revenue upside going forward, given industry revenues are still off from their historical relationship to GDP, barriers to demand are falling and business and international trends are promising. There are also certain industry constraints on growth in the near term, notably related to pilot and aircraft supply. And at American, we have completed a $1.3 billion cost reduction program.
In fact, in the face of increased fuel prices, we were profitable for the month of March, excluding net special items, due to our strong revenue performance and cost efficiencies. Our fleet remains the youngest and most fuel-efficient among the U.S. global network carriers. This month, we completed our narrow-body fleet harmonization project.
It covers more than 500 aircraft and will ensure a consistent product and better experience for customers, along with the improved revenue generation and unit cost production associated with the new seating configurations. In the first quarter, we took delivery of nine Airbus 321neos and reactivated seven previously stored Boeing 737-800s. We also inducted eight dual-class regional aircraft and parked three 50-seat Embraer 145s. As previously disclosed, we made several updates to our fleet order book and the timing of future deliveries, allowing us to better meet the demand strength in domestic and short-haul international markets.
With these changes, our expected total aircraft capex is $1.8 billion in 2022 and $2.2 billion in 2023. We ended the first quarter with $15.5 billion of total available liquidity, significantly higher than our initial forecast due to ATL build of $2.3 billion in the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $1.3 billion and free cash flow of more than $350 million in the first quarter. Deleveraging our balance sheet remains a top priority, and we are committed to significant debt reduction in the years ahead.
Even in this volatile environment, we remain on track with our target of reducing overall debt levels by $15 billion by the end of 2025. During the quarter, we made $344 million in scheduled debt payments and completed $317 million in open market repurchases of our $750 million unsecured senior notes maturing in June. To date, we have reduced our overall debt levels by $4.1 billion from our peak levels in the second quarter of 2021. We expect to make $1 billion of scheduled debt payments in the second quarter, which includes the remaining outstanding balance of the unsecured senior notes.
Lastly, with cost-efficient financing secured for all aircraft deliveries through the third quarter of this year, we are now beginning to evaluate financing options for the fourth quarter and first half of 2023. As we look at the second quarter, we expect to be profitable despite the expectation of continued elevated fuel prices. Pretax margins are expected to be between 3% and 5% for the quarter based on the current demand trends and our fuel price forecast. Based on current demand assumptions, we expect total revenue to be 6% to 8% higher versus the second quarter of 2019 on 6% to 8% lower capacity.
Our current forecast for the second quarter, which we pegged on Tuesday, assumes fuel between $3.59 and $3.64 per gallon, an increase of more than 60% versus the price of fuel in the second quarter of 2019. In the near term, the demand environment is strong, but margins are lower than they otherwise would have been given the recent run-up in fuel. Longer term, this industry has proven that it has the ability to recapture increases in the cost of fuel and be profitable at elevated fuel prices. We believe this time is no different.
As for full year 2022 capacity, we now expect to be recovered to 92% to 94% of 2019 levels. The reduction in full year capacity from our prior guide is largely due to 788 delivery delays that I touched on earlier. This capacity guidance is, of course, subject to future demand environment and fuel prices. Consequently, with this lower level of capacity, we now expect our full year CASM, excluding fuel and net special items, to be up between 8% and 10% versus 2019.
In conclusion, with the actions we have taken and the commitment of our team, we remain very well positioned. We remain focused on running a reliable operation and returning to profitability, which we expect to happen in the second quarter. With that, we'll open up the line for analyst questions.",29.0,
AAL,2022,2,"Good morning, and welcome to the American Airlines Group second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] And now I would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, head of investor relations, Mr. Scott Long.

A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release, which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.
Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I want to start by thanking the American Airlines team, which has done an amazing job of running our airline, especially during very challenging operating conditions in the past few months. They managed significant weather, both thunderstorms, and extreme heat in many parts of the country.
We've made a lot of progress on running a reliable airline, but we have still some work to do, and I'll touch up on that more in a moment. The big news is this, we're really pleased to report a quarterly profit for the first time since the start of the pandemic, that's two and a half years, that's driven by the strong demand environment and the hard work of our team. We're also pleased to have hit our pre-tax margin guidance, despite a challenging end of the quarter and a significant run-up in oil prices. American reported second quarter GAAP net income of $476 million.
So I want to close by reiterating that I'm tremendously excited about what lies ahead for American. We're encouraged by the trends we're seeing across the business, and we've built an airline that can be successful in a number of different demand and economic environments. Our second quarter results and strong revenue production, despite challenging conditions, demonstrates that our plan to return to profitability and deliver a good operation for our customers is working. We have the strongest assets in the industry, and the work that our team has accomplished to build and deliver the most comprehensive network in the business is paying off.
Operating earnings improved sequentially through the quarter, in line with the growth in revenue, despite rising fuel costs. We continue to reap the benefit of the past investments in our fleet and are well positioned for the future. In the second quarter, we took delivery of five A321neos and reactivated nine Boeing 737-800s from long-term storage. We continue to work closely with Boeing and the timing of our delayed 788s, and we expect to begin taking delivery of those aircraft this quarter.
We ended the second quarter with $15.6 billion of total available liquidity. During the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $1.7 billion and free cash flow of more than $800 million. Total debt reduction remains a top priority. We remain on track with our target of reducing overall debt levels by $15 billion by the end of 2025.
In the near term, we will continue to keep up -- keep our liquidity at elevated levels, with a plan to step down to $10 billion to $12 billion when we are confident the recovery has fully taken hold. At that time, any excess liquidity will be prioritized to reduce debt. During the quarter, we made $1 billion in scheduled debt and finance lease payments, including paying off the remaining outstanding balance of our $750 million unsecured senior notes that matured in June. To date, we have reduced overall debt levels by $5.2 billion from peak levels in the second quarter of 2021.
This means that after only 12 months, we have completed more than one-third of our $15 billion total debt reduction target. This progress affords us tremendous flexibility as to when and how we bring down the remaining $10 billion in total debt by the end of 2025. As we have said previously, moving forward, we will continue to balance our total liquidity with the expected demand recovery, debt reduction opportunities, and investment in the business. We expect to make $375 million of scheduled debt payments in the third quarter, which includes the scheduled payoff and unencumbering of eight CRJ-700 aircraft.
As we look to the remainder of the year, we are making targeted investments to ensure operational reliability. With recent schedule adjustments, we now expect full year 2022 capacity to be recovered to 90.5% of 2019 levels. Consequently, we now expect our full year CASM, excluding fuel and net special items, to be up between 10% and 12% versus 2019. The increase in unit cost is driven by lower planned capacity and other investments to support the operation, including wage premiums and regional pilot pay.
These unit cost increases represent near-term investments that will drive long-term value. We are confident that unit costs will improve as we increase asset utilization to historical levels. In the third quarter, we expect to be profitable, despite the continuation of elevated fuel prices. Pretax margins are expected to be between 2% and 4% for the quarter based on the current demand trends and our latest fuel price forecast.
We currently expect total revenue to be 10% to 12% higher versus the third quarter of 2019 on 8% to 10% lower capacity. On this revenue strength, we expect total revenue per ASM to be 20% to 24% higher in the third quarter versus the same period in 2019. We expect our third quarter CASM, excluding fuel and net special items, to be up between 12% and 14% compared to 2019. Lower planned capacity and the investment in the reliability of the operation that I mentioned previously are driving unit costs higher for the quarter.
Our current forecast for the third quarter assumes fuel between $3.73 and $3.78 per gallon, an increase of more than 80% versus the price of fuel in the third quarter of 2019. In conclusion, demand is strong, and we remain focused on our key objectives of operational reliability and profitability. While we've made investments in our operation that will impact near-term costs, we are confident that we're very well positioned as we move into 2023 because of our network, our fleet, our team and the actions we have taken. With that, we will open up the line for analyst questions.",29.0,

ADP,2022,1,"During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that excludes the impact of certain items. A description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release.
Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involves some risks. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.
As you will recall, we've been sharing our sales productivity trends over the course of the pandemic, and I'm pleased to report that in Q1, we were well above pre-pandemic levels. We reached this result several months sooner than we expected and we expect this to continue as we look ahead.
We fielded a number of questions these past several months about what we think might drive workers back into the labor force. While we don't have an answer to that question, what we can tell you is that we continue to see positive trends. Our clients are eager to hire and we are seeing workers return to the labor force, even if it's gradual. As a result, we expect to benefit from above-normal -- an above-normal level of pays-per-control growth over the course of the year.
In addition to the very strong ES performance, our PEO delivered another stellar quarter with 15% revenue growth and 15% average worksite employee growth, even better than the high expectations we had coming into the quarter. There were multiple drivers to the outperformance in the PEO, including the strong level of hiring within the client base, resilient retention and the improved bookings performance I mentioned earlier. We are very pleased with the momentum we see building in the PEO and we're raising our full year guidance accordingly.
I'd like to also share that at the annual HR Tech Conference a few weeks ago, our innovative Diversity, Equity and Inclusion tool on the data cloud platform was named a Top HR Product. This recognition adds to ADP's long-standing history of award wins at the conference, marking an unprecedented seventh consecutive year ADP has been honored for its innovative HCM technology. You can probably tell from the number of times we've highlighted data cloud, that our velocity of innovation has increased significantly there.
Moving on to the segments. Our Employer Services revenue increased 8% on a reported and organic constant currency basis. Our strong Q1 ES bookings performance and record retention contributed to this performance, though, as a reminder, we did continue to lap some of the lower revenues we had last year in some of our volume-related businesses, including recruiting and background screening. Our clients funding interest represented only a slight headwind in the quarter as our 40 basis point decline in average yield was offset by fantastic balanced growth of 22%, driven by client growth, employment growth, higher wages and the lapping of the payroll tax deferral last year. ES margin increased 150 basis points on strong revenue performance and overall cost containment.
We are also raising our ES retention and we are now assuming a decline of 50 basis points off of FY '21s all-time highs versus our prior outlook of a decline of 75 basis points. As with bookings, this is primarily a function of the strong Q1 performance. Our continued assumption is that as clients continue to reengage in the marketplace, we may experience a slight decline over the course of the year. We expect to have significantly more clarity once we get through the calendar year end period where we typically see most of the switching activity. For U.S. pays-per-control, we're making no change to our outlook of 4% to 5% growth. We continue to expect a gradual recovery in the overall labor market, and the 7% growth in Q1 was about in line with our expectations.
Putting it all together for our consolidated outlook, we now expect revenue to grow 7% to 8%. Following the strong 10% Q1 performance, we now expect the remaining quarters to grow closer to 7%, which is higher than our prior forecast. For adjusted EBIT margin, we now expect an increase of 50 to 75 basis points. As we shared last quarter, we expect our margin improvement to be back half-weighted, most specifically in the fourth quarter. Our current expectation is for a slight margin decline in Q2 and Q3. We're making no change to our tax rate assumption. And with these changes, we now expect growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 11% to 13%.
As I think you've heard us say a couple of times now, we are very pleased with our Q1 results and we're happy to be raising our guidance this early in the year. This is still a dynamic environment and there are a wide range of potential outcomes, and we believe our guidance is appropriately balanced, given these conditions. However, should our associates continue to drive better than expected sales results, client satisfaction, efficiency and service implementation, we would see opportunity to deliver additional upside to our outlook.
Before we move to Q&A, I wanted to share two things. First, I look forward to meeting everyone, perhaps virtually for now, but eventually in person as we get back out on the road to meet our shareholders and the investment community. And second is that we are very much looking forward to our upcoming Investor Day in a couple of weeks on November 15. Having run one of our largest businesses for years, I can tell you, there is always much happening here at ADP underground. And although it all tends to roll up to a very stable financial picture, I can tell you, there is really a lot of excitement among our associates for the things they're working on. We hope to share some of that excitement with you in November.",14.0,Low

ADSK,2022,1,"In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com/investor. You can find the earnings press release, slide presentation, and transcript of today's opening commentary on our investor relations website following this call. During the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements about our outlook, future results, and related assumptions, acquisitions, products, and product capabilities and strategies. These statements reflect our best judgment based on currently known factors.
We are thinking about you, and we are helping wherever we can. Thank you to all our employees and their families, our partners, and customers for their continued resilience, patience, and commitment. Our first quarter marks an important inflection point. While solid execution, a resilient subscription business model, and continued secular shift to the cloud underpinned our strong first-quarter results, weighing uncertainty and growing confidence in our end markets generated momentum.
Robust growth in new product subscriptions, combined with improving usage and renewal rates, accelerated billings and RPO growth to 10% and 22%, respectively. Together, these reinforce our confidence that we are through the revenue growth trough and on track to achieve our fiscal '22 and '23 goals. In mid-May, we completed the acquisition of Upchain, a cloud-native product data and life cycle management solution. Combined with existing Autodesk offerings like Fusion 360, Upchain will profoundly simplify data sharing and collaboration for engineers, manufacturers, suppliers, and other product stakeholders, enabling customers to bring products to market faster and build a stronger supply chain.
Its next-generation platform enables it to be rapidly deployed, scaled, maintained, and updated without the expensive inflexible, and time-consuming integrations of legacy systems. We will grow Upchain through our enterprise and channel partnerships and expect it to become a meaningful on-ramp for legacy design tools to the Fusion 360 cloud ecosystem and facilitate further expansion into adjacent verticals. As we highlighted in our recently published Impact Report, the convergence of design and make brings both greater efficiency and sustainability to buildings in a broad range of manufactured goods, stretching from EVs and bicycles to high-performance skis and low-cost ventilators. While we are enabling customers to achieve their sustainability targets, we continue to lead by example, reaching our carbon-neutral goal across our business and value chain in fiscal '21.
The report also sets out new diversity, equity, and inclusion goals. And while I'm proud that 50% of Autodesk Board and 45% of our executive team are women, we can and will do more both internally and through partnerships with organizations like IFF Labs externally. As we recently announced, Pascal Di Fronzo, Autodesk's executive vice president of corporate affairs and chief legal officer, will be retiring in December after 23 very successful years at the company. He has been a trusted counselor and steward of the company.
His contributions to Autodesk are many and have been incredibly impactful, and I want to thank him for his dedication and wish him all the best in retirement. I am very excited to welcome Debbie back to Autodesk, and will now turn the call over to her to take you through the details of our quarterly results and guidance for the year. I will then come back to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives.
Total revenue in the quarter grew 12% and 11% in constant currency, with subscription revenue growing by 18%. Looking at revenue by product and geography, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenue grew by 9%. AEC revenue grew 16% and manufacturing revenue grew 8%. Excluding the impact of moving our bulk product to ratable revenue recognition, which we discussed last quarter, manufacturing revenue grew double digits.
Reflecting the business-critical nature of our products to our customers, our net revenue retention rate remained within the 100% to 110% range, and our product subscription renewal rates strengthened. Our billings accelerated 10% to $974 million. Total deferred revenue grew 11% to $3.35 billion. Short-term deferred revenue increased 17%, primarily reflecting growth in new product subscriptions and increasing renewal rates, but also the inclusion of Innovyze.
Now I'll shift to giving you my initial thoughts as CFO and then finish with our outlook. Since I rejoined Autodesk about two months ago, I've been focused on two things: first, reacquainting myself with everything Autodesk, the team, our strategy, and how we've evolved during my two years away; and second, I've been digging deep to gain a solid understanding of our fiscal '22 budget and fiscal '23 financial goals. On the first point, while much at Autodesk is familiar to me, I've been pleasantly surprised by how much has changed for the better, reflecting the enormous progress Autodesk has made over the last two years. Autodesk has undergone a cultural revolution.
There's been a powerful shift in the company's values and ways we work, and the pace of decision-making has accelerated. As a company, we now benefit not only from the scale of our operation, but also from a newfound agility that is enabling our success in newer markets like construction and manufacturing in the cloud. I'm also struck by the compelling and expanding opportunities ahead of us. Digital transformation is happening now, it is real, and we are well-positioned to capitalize on that trend in the industries we serve.
As I begin to turn my attention to our long-range financial plan, these initial learnings give me confidence in our growth potential in fiscal '24 and beyond. Let me finish with our guidance, which now includes Innovyze and Upchain. We still expect that an improving economic environment during the year will result in strong growth in new business over the course of fiscal '22. We expect product subscription renewal rates to continue to be healthy and our net revenue retention rate to remain between 100% and 110%.
We expect non-GAAP operating margin to expand to between 30% and 31%, which includes approximately 1 percentage point of negative headwind from acquisitions. Finally, we still expect free cash flow to be around $1.6 billion with a broadly neutral impact from acquisitions. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for the second fiscal quarter and full-year '22. With improving economic conditions and easier comparables, we still expect our first-quarter revenue growth will be the trough.
Our accelerating momentum in fiscal '22 will propel us into fiscal '23, and I am therefore confident in our fiscal '23 revenue growth potential and free cash flow target of $2.4 billion. As I begin to look beyond fiscal '23, the digital transformation of the industries we serve, our sustained investment in the cloud, and our flexible business model give us a robust platform for double-digit growth. Andrew, back to you.
Thank you, Debbie. Let me finish by giving you an update on our strategic growth initiatives. The secular trends we have been investing in for years have accelerated during the pandemic: the digitization of AEC, the convergence of design and make and our expansion into adjacent verticals through organic investment and acquisitions are growing our total addressable market. The evolution of our business model, the value generated by the growing connectivity of our platform for new and legacy customers, and the hardening of our systems to noncompliant users enables us to attract, retain more of that potential opportunity, growing our ecosystem and the usage and value we generate from it.
Turning to AEC. Our unique vision is to connect all the phases of construction with end-to-end cloud-based solutions that combine horizontal data flow with best-in-class functionality to enable seamless collaboration from planning, design, preconstruction, construction, asset operations, and maintenance. The breadth and depth of our solutions distinguish us in the market, and we continue to build on that advantage to industry-leading R&D, which we sustain through the pandemic and acquisitions. Our latest product releases reflect that.
The department was particularly impressed by connected bridge design workflows between Revit and InfraWorks that drive efficiency and sustainability. Turning to manufacturing. We have made significant organic investments in addition to Upchain. Inventor 2022 introduced new features and enhancements to speed up product development and interoperability with AutoCAD, Fusion 360, and Revit.
In Fusion 360, we have introduced new functionality across the entire product development process and numerous integrated extensions that unlock advanced design and manufacturing technologies. In Vault, we introduced a new mobile application and web browser experience for engineers and non-CAD users to access their real-time data anywhere and on any device. The potential to converge design and make in the cloud is becoming more of a reality every day to our customer. Autodesk continues to lead that transition.
With the largest number of new commercial users in 2020, Fusion 360's strong momentum continued, growing commercial subscriptions to 152,000 without any systematic cost promotions. While still early in its life cycle, we believe Fusion 360 has reached an adoption tipping point. And with extensions and Upchain, we are excited about its future. During the quarter, a U.K.-based design, manufacturing, and installer of architectural precast design invested in Fusion 360 in its nesting and fabrication extension.
Jeremiah Williams, Director for Integrated Machining Technology at Danville Community College said that, ""By testing a variety of advanced skills like welding and multiaccess machining, as well as communication and teamwork, the Project MFG National Championship is one of the most challenging skilled trade competitions in the country. Fusion 360's next-generation platform enabled our team to complete all required and optional objectives from prototype through to welding and machining the finished product and to win this prestigious prize."" As announced last quarter, we expanded our multiuser trade-in to August 2023, but we are still seeing customers convert and benefit from kind of transition to named users. SSP, one of the leading integrated design offices in Germany, traded in their multiuser licenses with us this quarter and significantly increased their investment by purchasing additional AEC collections and premium subscriptions, in the process, may completely replace the competitive design solution, standardizing their workflow on our cloud platform. The premium plan is especially valuable to them as they improve their site-to-site management using single sign-on, which enables more digital collaboration and efficiency while increasing employee satisfaction.
Following a catastrophic fire in 2019, the cathedral is being rebuilt with traditional and sustainable materials enhanced by next-generation building information modeling provided by Autodesk. Combining traditional design and build know-how with modern workflow solutions, reconstruction is expected to be completed in 2024 in time to welcome athletes at the Summer Olympics in Paris and future generations from across the globe. I share this because as the world rebuilds after the catastrophic impact of the pandemic, I am reminded again that Autodesk's purpose to enable its customers to build and manufacture efficiently and sustainably has never been more important or urgent. Together, we can meet the generational challenges posed by carbon, water, and waste.",16.0,Negligible
ADSK,2022,3,"In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com/investor. You can find the earnings press release, slide presentation, and transcript of today's opening commentary on our Investor Relations website following this call. During the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements about our outlook, future results, and related assumptions, acquisitions, products, and product capabilities and strategies. These statements reflect our best judgment based on currently known factors.
While demand is robust, we believe supply chain disruption and resulting inflationary pressures, a global labor shortage, making it harder for our customers to staff new projects and the ebb and flow of COVID are contributing to the deceleration, as well as documented country-specific disruption to AEC in China. Our conversation with customers and channel partners reinforces our view. We're encouraged that embracing digital transformation to drive efficiency and sustainability remains a priority for our customers. Our end-to-end solutions, business model flexibility and platform position us well competitively and enable more customers to enter and remain in our ecosystem.
As you heard at our recent Investor Day at Autodesk University, we are rapidly innovating and optimizing our business to increase and realize the opportunity ahead. Notable milestones during the quarter included the launch of our Flex consumption model and our plans to combine technologies, connect processes, automate workflows, and unlock valuable insights for customers through our Forge platform. The recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the United Nations Climate Change COP26 meeting in Glasgow, both underscore the urgency of reducing carbon in earth's atmosphere and the role that everyone, including corporations needs to play. Sustainability needs to be designed, made and, in many cases, retrofitted in construction and manufacturing.
This cannot be achieved efficiently or effectively without end-to-end software like ours to drive the process. This organizing principle affects not just how we deploy capital, for example, through our investments to develop sustainable tools and our recent acquisition of Innovyze, but also how we source capital. Many of our largest equity holders already aligned to our sustainability goals. In the third quarter, we began to align our debt holders by issuing our first sustainability bond linked to our sustainability goals.
Now let me turn the call over to Debbie to take you through the details of our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. I'll then come back to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives. 
We delivered healthy free cash flow of $257 million during the quarter against a tough comparison from last year, which benefited from pandemic-related payment term extensions. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we continue to repurchase shares to offset dilution from our equity plans. During the third quarter, we purchased 980,000 shares for $287 million at an average price of approximately $293 per share. Year to date, we've repurchased 1.66 million shares at an average price of approximately $287 per share for total spend of $476 million.
Looking forward, as Andrew said, we're rapidly innovating and optimizing our business to realize the opportunities ahead. As we discussed last quarter, the shift of multiyear contracts to annual billings as we move into fiscal '24 will drive more predictable free cash flow and better price realization over time, which will make Autodesk a more valuable company. This quarter, we took steps to optimize our capital structure by issuing our first sustainability bonds, which aligns our capital strategy with our sustainability goals, while also extending our debt maturity profile by almost two years and reducing our weighted average cost of debt by 40 basis points. As we enter Q4, we intend to take steps to reduce our real estate footprint because the pandemic has spurred changes in the way we work, and we've moved to a hybrid workforce.
Demand was robust in Q3, and we expect it to remain so in Q4. However, as Andrew said, macroeconomic headwinds, such as supply chain disruption and resulting inflationary pressures, a global labor shortage, the ebb and flow of COVID and AEC in China are impacting the pace of our recovery. As an example, the growth in new product subscription volumes decelerated from approximately 30% in the first half to mid-20s percent in Q3, which is more than normal seasonality and a tougher comparison versus last year would suggest. This dynamic drove strong billings growth in Q3 that, nonetheless, fell short of our expectations.
But if the growth deceleration and strengthened dollar continue through next year, we could see potential risk to that target of about $100 million to $200 million based on what we know today. FX volatility is a big factor. Rate moves in the first half of the year created about $55 million in potential headwind to fiscal '23 cash flow. Since then and in the last 90 days alone, further rate moves created about another $45 million in potential headwind to cash flow.
We're obviously watching FX rates closely, but it's clear that if the current rates persist through next year, that risk could materialize in free cash flow. Beyond cash flow, if you further take the risk into account, revenue growth could end up at the low end of the CAGR we talked about at Investor Day. And fiscal '23 margin could be impacted by about 1 point. We will, of course, update you on our next earnings call when we expect to have more visibility into any impact from macro or FX movements on our fiscal '23 outlook.
Thank you, Debbie. Now let me turn to our strategic growth initiatives. Sustained and purposeful innovation to enable digital transformation in the industries we serve has changed our relationship with our customers from software vendor to a strategic partner, and that is enabling us to create more value through end-to-end cloud-based solutions that connect data and workflows and through business model evolution. Our model is scalable and extensible into adjacent verticals, from architecture and engineering through construction owners, and from product engineering to product manufacturing, and product and data life cycle management.
By helping our customers grow and navigate their digital transformation, we will grow, too. For example, Bouygues Construction and Colas are leading construction and infrastructure firms based in France with over 100,000 construction employees operating in 60 countries across the globe. In the third quarter, they significantly increased their commitment to Autodesk products such as Revit, AutoCAD and Civil 3D following an accelerated move to BIM and digital workflows over the last three years, which significantly increased monthly average users. Similarly, Obayashi Corporation, one of the largest construction firms in Japan, which operates in 16 countries worldwide, is accelerating its global consolidation around BIM and a unified 3D technology platform to enable greater efficiency and sustainability.
Fewer promotions and growing demand for Fusion 360's extensions are enabling us to capture more of the potential market opportunity and accelerate our growth. Fast Radius is a leading digital manufacturing and supply chain company. The company's proprietary cloud manufacturing platform combines software and advanced micro-factories that enable its customers to flexibly design, make and move certified products. Fast Radius already uses several Autodesk products.
This quarter, it added Fusion 360 with a machining extension to support its in-house CNC operation and integrate it alongside its existing additive manufacturing offering. Fusion 360 enables Fast Radius to program a wide variety of parts more quickly, resulting in faster product cycle times. Outside of commercial use, there is a large and rapidly growing ecosystem of users that are taking Fusion 360 from education and home into the workplace. These will fuel commercial usage in the future.
Together, we can meet the challenges posed by carbon, water, and waste, while also advancing equity and access to the in-demand skills of the future. Autodesk's central role in meeting these challenges underpins my confidence this year and my confidence in the future. Operator, we would now like to open the call for questions. ",16.0,Negligible
ADSK,2022,4,"In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com/investor. You can find the earnings press release, slide presentation, and transcript of today's opening commentary on our Investor Relations website following this call. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements about our outlook, future results, and related assumptions, acquisitions, products and product capabilities and strategies. These statements reflect our best judgment based on currently known factors.
Let me talk briefly about each of these as they are just as important to our future growth as they have been to our growth in the past. All of our technology investments, be it in 3D and BIM, enabling workflows in the cloud in generative design, in make, and in newer verticals like water and construction. All of them connect siloed adjacent workflows in the cloud and lead our customers to new, more efficient and sustainable ways of working. At Autodesk University, we announced we were moving from products to platforms and capabilities, and bringing those capabilities to any device anywhere to the cloud.
Fusion 360 is the leading edge of this transition and our recent acquisitions of Prodsmart and CIMCO will enable us to further digitize and connect shop floor processes and manufacturing to help build connected factories while providing additional on-ramps into and usage of our manufacturing platform. Similarly, our acquisitions of Moxion and LoUPE enable us to connect media and entertainment workflows and data from postproduction to preproduction. With media and entertainment signing its largest-ever EBA in the fourth quarter, the ability to connect preproduction workflows further expands our addressable TAM. We're also continuing to invest in our workforce, attract and retain the best talent in our industries and cultivate a shared sense of purpose and of diversity, and belonging.
We recently received recognition for that work with inclusion on the Corporate Knights index of the world's most sustainable companies and the highest possible score on the Human Rights Foundation's Corporate Equality Index. We are proud of our purpose and unique culture, one consequence of which is relatively low attrition compared to our technology peers. This is another source of competitive advantage in tight labor market. It also means that when gifted leaders like Scott Reese and Pascal Di Fronzo decide to climb their next mountains, we have a deep bench of internal talent like Jeff Kinder and Rebecca Pearce; and alumnae, like Ruth Ann Keene, to step into their shoes.
As of February 1, we unified all customer and partner-facing activities, marketing, go-to-market, customer success, and customer operations under our COO, Steve Blum to give us a better end-to-end view of the customer experience and to drive sustainable competitive advantage and growth. While the pandemic and its aftershocks mean we will fall narrowly short of the financial targets set more than five years ago, we have made tremendous progress through consistent investment in our technology, our workforce, and our business model and customer experience, which have added adjacent use cases and usage in our ecosystem, growing our addressable market and our ability to realize it. Importantly, the pandemic has accelerated the structural growth drivers underpinning our future growth. We have robust momentum as we enter fiscal '23 and over the long term.
Now let me turn the call over to Debbie to take you through the details of our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. I'll then come back to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives.
You'll see us continue to be opportunistic with share buybacks, but our capital-allocation strategy is unchanged. We'll invest organically and inorganically to drive growth, as well as purchase shares to offset dilution from our equity compensation plans over time. Now let me finish with guidance. On our last call, we signaled that we saw FX headwinds and macroeconomic uncertainty due to supply chain challenges, labor shortages, and the ebb and flow of COVID.
That perspective hasn't changed. So the risk we highlighted three months ago is now incorporated into our fiscal '23 outlook. Beyond that, we did see further strengthening of the U.S. dollar, resulting in a slight incremental FX headwind to our fiscal '23 expectations.
And we've assumed that market conditions in fiscal '23 are consistent with what we experienced in the second half of fiscal '22. We expect fiscal '23 revenue to be between $5.02 billion and $5.12 billion with growth of approximately 16% at the midpoint, and which reflects an incremental 1-percentage-point FX headwind, as I mentioned earlier. We expect non-GAAP operating margins to be approximately 37% and free cash flow to be between $2.13 billion and $2.21 billion. The midpoint of that range, $2.17 billion, implies 47% growth and reflects the incremental $30 million FX headwind that I mentioned earlier.
The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for Q1 and full year fiscal '23. The pandemic has reinforced the structural growth drivers underpinning our strategy, and we remain confident in our long-term growth potential. We continue to target double-digit revenue growth, non-GAAP operating margins in the 38% to 40% range, and double-digit free cash flow growth on a compound annual basis. These metrics are intended to provide a floor to our revenue growth ambitions and a ceiling to our spend growth expectations.
Thank you, Debbie. Our strategy is to transform the industries we serve with end-to-end cloud-based solutions that enable our customers to drive efficiency and sustainability. Structural growth drivers underpinning the strategy have been reinforced by the pandemic, including increased workflow convergence and platform standardization, a growing focus on distributed working in the cloud, automation, and workforce productivity and also the growing importance of sustainability. Our model is scalable and extensible into adjacent verticals from architecture and engineering, through construction and owners from product engineering through product manufacturing and product data management.
And as I stated earlier, with our consistent investment in our technology, our workforce, and our business model and customer experience, we are well-positioned to realize these opportunities. And so by both leading and partnering with our customers on new ways of working, we will grow too. For example, Goldbeck is one of Europe's largest commercial design and construction companies and a leading practitioner of industrialized construction, and they use Inventor, Revit, Forge, and generative design on our platform to implement their precast and modular system concept. By standardizing the invisible and customizing the visible, Goldbeck has been able to design and build highly customized and aesthetically pleasing buildings reliably, quickly, and efficiently.
Having unified around BIM, Goldbeck is now seeking to grow and connect beyond the design process to further improve efficiency and reduce waste through design automation during capital planning, for which it is trialing Spacemaker and great collaboration across design and build phases of construction using Autodesk Construction Cloud. With the launch of Autodesk Build, the introduction of an account-based pricing business model and distribution through our channel partners, we are extending our reach into the construction market. For example, Lee Lewis Construction, an ENR 400 general contractor from Texas, has been driving innovation through construction technology for over 45 years. In 2021, it began adopting capabilities of the Autodesk Construction Cloud, beginning with Assemble for Virtual Design and Construction with the end goal of a full replacement of their product management software with Autodesk Build.
By having one platform for the full end-to-end construction workflow, Lee Lewis will be able to more efficiently deliver extraordinary results for their clients, from concept planning to ribbon cutting. With strong growth from Autodesk Build and the benefit of recently launched ACC bundles for preconstruction and construction operations, Autodesk Construction Cloud reported its best-ever quarter and accelerating growth in the fourth quarter, entering FY '23 with strong momentum. We continue connecting the dots in infrastructure too, most recently through the acquisition of Innovyze. Sustainable water is an area of opportunity for Autodesk across the globe.
For example, Thames Water owns and operates one of the oldest and most complicated water supply networks in Europe, supplying 9 million customers in London and the Thames Valley. With InfoWorks WS Pro and IWLive Pro from Innovyze and an ongoing recruitment drive to double the size of their internal hydraulic modeling team, it is building a modeling center of excellence with a library of hydraulic models that can be run in near real time. When connected and compared with telemetry, these dynamic digital twins will become powerful planning tools, enabling Thames Water's teams to gain near real-time insight into system performance, leading to improved outcomes for the customers of today and tomorrow. I'm very pleased to report that Innovyze had its best quarter ever.
Turning to manufacturing. We sustained strong momentum in our manufacturing portfolio this quarter as we connect more workflows beyond the design studio and develop more on-ramps to our manufacturing platform. In automotive, we continue to grow our footprint beyond the design studio and into manufacturing-connected factories as automotive OEMs seek to break down work silos and shorten handoff and design cycles. For example, a multinational automobile company, which designs and jointly manufactures premium electric cars operates in four countries across the world and is currently in the process of expanding to a further 20.
While we often think of education users taking Fusion 360 with them into the workforce, our commercial customers are also taking Fusion 360 into education to help train their future workforce. For example, Lawrence Equipment, as a member of the Pasadena City College Advisory Board, showed the college how Fusion 360 had helped innovate and improve its design and manufacturing workflows, resulting in greater operational efficiency, improved productivity, and higher quality production. Upon adoption for its machine shop program, the college immediately found that students using Fusion 360 are spending less time learning how to use the software and more time on the machines, learning important machining skills. The students also better understood how their work affected the company.
By standardizing on common tools across its global studios, Technicolor can unleash the creative potential of its remote and distributed workforce. By efficiently and securely connecting teams, Technicolor can continue to serve the growing demand for compelling content, redefining what's possible for storytellers and audiences around the globe. And finally, we continue to enable more users to participate in our ecosystem more productively through business model innovation and our license compliance initiatives. With single sign-on for improved security and user-level reporting, our premium plan enables our customers to manage their software usage across distributed sites more safely and efficiently.
Our collaborative helpful approach enabled more users to access the latest versions of our software and upgrading to our premium plan made it easier to administer and manage access in the future. During the quarter, we closed 16 deals over $500,000 of our license compliance initiatives, four of which were over $1 million. As I said earlier, by both leading and partnering with our customers on new ways of working, we will grow too. And while there will certainly be twists and turns on the road ahead, in many ways, the pandemic has accelerated the future and increased my confidence in our strategy.",16.0,Negligible
ADSK,2023,1,"In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com/investor. You will find the earnings press release, slide presentation, and transcript of today's opening commentary on our Investor Relations website following this call. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements about our outlook, future results, and related assumptions, acquisitions, products, and product capabilities and strategies. These statements reflect our best judgment based on currently known factors.
Thank you, Simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. Today, we reported record first-quarter revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, and free cash flow fueled by strong demand and a robust, competitive performance. The structural growth drivers for our business that were critical to our performance during the pandemic, such as flexibility and agility, continue to support and propel us during elevated macroeconomic, geopolitical, and policy uncertainty. These growth drivers further cement the important role we play in our customers' digital transformation and increase our confidence in our strategy.
And our customers can extend those capabilities through our partnerships with Aurigo in capital planning and ESRI in geospatial mapping. This is important because governments and asset owners across the globe are investing growing amounts in next-generation infrastructure to meet the societal and environmental needs of the next century and are retooling now to do it. That equals opportunity for Autodesk. For example, in the first quarter, we signed our second largest EBA ever with a large global infrastructure company in a deal that included Innovyze and Autodesk Build for the first time.
Across Autodesk, we are focused on unifying more common data and fluidly connecting more workflows in the cloud in ways that delight our customers and lead them to new, more efficient, and more sustainable ways of working. And by doing that, we will move beyond carbon neutrality for ourselves to transform our customers' carbon footprint. Together, we can design and make a better world for all that advances equitable access to the in-demand skills of the future. Before I turn the call over to Debbie to take you through the details of our financial performance and outlook, I want to update you on important decisions we made about our business in Russia.
You will recall that the invasion of Ukraine occurred hours before our last earnings call. In light of the conflict, we halted all of our new and renewal business in Russia on March 3. We strongly believe this decision was the right thing to do and that it is in our long-term interest, even though it comes at a cost, which Debbie will detail in a moment. Of course, our immediate focus remains on the safety and well-being of our employees in the region, and we continue to monitor the situation closely.
Beyond the immediate impact in Russia, other leading indicators trend positive. For example, usage remained steady in Europe during the quarter and grew in America and Asia-Pacific region, building connected bid activity again hit record levels, and our partner channel remains optimistic. The strong momentum sets us up well for the remainder of the year. Debbie, now over to you to take everyone through the details of our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year, I will come back afterwards to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives.
Billings increased 16% to $1.1 billion, reflecting robust underlying demand. Total deferred revenue grew 12% to $3.7 billion. Total RPO of $4.7 billion and current RPO of $3.1 billion grew 11% and 10% respectively, reflecting strong billings growth, and as I flagged last quarter, the timing and volume of multiyear contracts, which are typically on a three-year cycle. Turning to the P&L, non-GAAP gross margin remained broadly level at 92%, while non-GAAP operating margin increased by 6 percentage points to approximately 34%, reflecting strong revenue growth and ongoing cost discipline.
GAAP operating margins increased by 4 percentage points to approximately 18%. As Andrew mentioned, we delivered record first-quarter free cash flow of $422 million, up 34% year over year, reflecting strong billings growth in both Q4 and Q1. With the broad equity market pullback in Q1 and our strong cash position, we again accelerated our share repurchasing during the quarter. We purchased 2.1 million shares for $436 million at an average price of approximately $212 per share, which contributed to a reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding of approximately $2 million.
dollar. Our business continues to perform well and to post top-line growth ahead of our peers. As you can imagine, we are keeping a close eye on the geopolitical, macroeconomic, and policy environments. But against that backdrop in Q1, renewal rates remain strong, multiyear billings were in line with our expectations, and we exited the quarter with strong momentum.
Beyond Russia, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen during Q1. While we benefit from a robust hedging program, the pace of FX volatility has been incredibly rapid, and it's having an impact on our fiscal '23 outlook, reducing billings, revenue, and free cash flow by approximately $80 million, $20 million and $50 million, respectively. Bringing these factors together, we expect fiscal '23 revenue to be between $4.96 billion and $5.06 billion.
Thank you, Debbie. Our strategy is to transform the industries we serve with end-to-end, cloud-based solutions that drive efficiency and sustainability for our customers. Our business is scalable and extensible into adjacent verticals: from architecture and engineering through construction and owners, from product engineering to product data management and product manufacturing. It is also scalable and extensible between verticals with industrialized construction and into new workflows like XR.
By accelerating the convergence of workloads within and between the industries we serve, we are also creating broader and deeper partnerships with existing customers and bringing new customers into our ecosystem. For example, in AEC, AECOM is the world's most trusted infrastructure consulting firm that delivers professional services throughout the project lifecycle from planning, design, and engineering to program and construction management. With growing investment in infrastructure, customers are increasingly seeking both efficiency and sustainability to meet ESG goals such as net-zero carbon, resiliency, quality of life, social impact, and safety. This aligns AECOM and its customers closely with Autodesk's values and capabilities.
For example, Bravida, which is based in Sweden, is a leading provider of technical end-to-end consulting design, installation, and service solutions across the Nordic region, focusing on efficiency and sustainability. It is responsible for the installation of fire sprinklers, ventilation, electrics, and safety systems in the tunnels of The Stockholm Bypass Project, the largest infrastructure project in Sweden's history. Having adopted Autodesk's AEC collection and realizing 50% cost savings and a significant reduction in carbon dioxide using Revit in the design phase of the project, Bravida was looking for a complementary system to seamlessly connect the build phase. Adopting Autodesk Build enable it to connect office and field data and workflows in the cloud, standardize and track projects accurately and manage procurement and logistics, health and safety and cost more effectively and efficiently.
Turning to manufacturing, we sustained strong momentum in our manufacturing portfolio this quarter as we connected more workflows beyond the design studio, developed more on-ramps to our manufacturing platform, and delivered new powerful tools and functionality through Fusion 360 Extensions. As we connect and develop new workflows in the cloud and provide more ways for customers to use our products, we have the opportunity to renew engagement with some of our legacy customers. For example, a high-tech manufacturer in Germany, which has been using Autodesk software since 1991, was using Inventor software purchased in 2018. By updating from a perpetual license to a product design and manufacturing collection subscription in Q1, the team will benefit from significant process and performance improvements, which alleviate mechanical engineering bottlenecks and better serve its high-demand periods.
Because of its familiarity with Autodesk, the customer enabled these improvements immediately and leveraged its existing IP without migration. We are happy to have them back on our latest and most secure software. In automotive, we continue to grow our footprint beyond the design studio into manufacturing as automotive OEMs seek to break down work silos and shorten handoff and design cycles. Enovate Motors, an electric vehicle manufacturer in China, added product design and manufacturing collections on top of its Alias and VRED subscriptions to achieve a seamless digital workflow across design and manufacturing.
Enovate will be able to build higher quality cars more efficiently by connecting workloads in the cloud that enable more collaboration and better data integrity. Our Fusion 360 platform approach enables customers to seamlessly connect workflows while also delivering powerful tools and functionality to those that needed through extensions. For example, an educational toy manufacturer based in the U.S. started using Fusion 360 about a year ago and quickly recognized the impact working on the cloud would have on its ability to collaborate across sites between product design and product engineering.
Q1 was able to seamlessly activate manage, nesting, and product design extensions within the Fusion 360 user interface, giving access to even more powerful tools and functionality to those that needed it. For example, the Fusion 360 Manage Extension unlocks additional data management functionality to manage design changes at any stage of production with the click of a button using pre-built workflows. Fusion 360's commercial subscribers grew steadily, ending the quarter with 198,000 subscribers with demand for our new extensions, including machining, generative design, and nesting and fabrication, continuing to grow at an exceptional pace. Outside of commercial use, our education partnerships are helping students learn the in-demand skills of the future.
To support its standardization effort across all projects of regions, the BESIX group uses BIM Collaborate Pro and Docs to collaborate on Revit projects in a secure common data environment. For additional security and efficiency, it now leverages our premium plan in Flex. By better understanding its usage through the enhanced reporting functions within our premium plant, it can provide access to occasional users through Flex while realizing the additional security benefits of single sign-on across its global employee base. We continue to work with our customers to maximize their access to current and secure versions of our software.
For example, an international research institution in Europe, which is both students and employees, was mistakenly using education subscriptions for commercial use cases. By partnering with their leadership, we ensured the relevant departments had access to the necessary tools by combining subscriptions to our industry collections with Flex tokens. The collaborative approach resulted in a compliance deal of over 1 million euros. During the quarter, we closed eight deals over $500,000 of our license compliances, two of which were over $1 million.
Autodesk partnered with Smithsonian to create an interactive experience called Future Communities that brings visitors together to build a sustainable community block using analytics and goal-driven design with Autodesk generative design technology. Guests collaborate both with each other and AI, adjusting the input they deem most important. Each guest takes on a different persona with specific goals and input factors, which include social, ecological, and economic considerations, ranging from availability of green space and low-carbon transportation to the reach of public services and employment opportunities. The evolving community block is displayed in real-time, and the technology showcases the types of trade-offs necessary to achieve various outcomes.
The exhibit structure was generally designed to be strong and lightweight, using sustainable materials and modular space frame components that can be easily assembled and disassembled for minimum construction waste. The exhibit not only represents Autodesk vision of the future, that of collaborative and connected workflows and data in the cloud that designs and makes a better world for all, that meets the challenges posed by carbon, water, and waste, and that advances equity and access to the in-demand skills of the future. But in addition, the exhibit represents a very diverse set of visions for how the future may unfold. The one thing they share is an unwavering sense of optimism about what we can all accomplish together.",16.0,Negligible
ADSK,2023,2,"Thank you for standing by, and welcome to Autodesk's second quarter fiscal 2023 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Simon Mays-Smith, vice president, investor relations.
In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com/investor. You can find the earnings press release, slide presentation, and transcript of today's opening commentary on our investor relations website following this call. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements about our outlook, future results, and related assumptions, acquisitions, products, and product capabilities and strategies. These statements reflect our best judgment based on currently known factors.
Thank you, Simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. Today, we reported record second quarter revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, and free cash flow. End market demand remained strong during the quarter, resulting in robust new business activity. Renewal rates were again excellent.
All of this and our strong competitive performance more than offset the direct and indirect impact of geopolitical, macroeconomic, policy, and COVID-19-related factors. Growing commercial usage outside China, Russia, and Ukraine, record bid activity on BuildingConnected, and continued channel partner optimism leave us well placed to achieve our FY '23 goals. As I said last quarter, the structural growth drivers for our business that were critical to our performance during the pandemic, such as flexibility and agility, continue to support and propel us during this period of elevated uncertainty. These growth drivers further cement the important role we play in our customers' digital transformations and increase our confidence in our strategy.
Our steady strategy, industry-leading products, platform, and business model innovation, sustained and focused investment and strong execution are creating additional opportunities for Autodesk. By accelerating the convergence of workflows within and between the industries we serve, we create broader and deeper partnerships with existing customers and bring new customers into our ecosystem. In pursuit of these goals, we announced at Autodesk University last year that we were moving from products to platforms and capabilities and bringing these capabilities to any device anywhere through the cloud. Over the coming weeks, months, and years, you will hear a lot more from us about our plans and progress to build a world-class customer experience, catalyze our customers' digital transformation and establish industry-leading platforms for design and make.
As evidence of the progress we have made already, Fusion 360 flew past 200,000 subscribers during the second quarter and signed its first million-dollar contract, both important milestones and indications of the opportunities ahead. I will now turn the call over to Debbie to take you through the details of our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. I'll then come back to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives.
Turning to the P&L. Non-GAAP gross margin remained broadly level at 92%, while non-GAAP operating margin increased by 5 percentage points to approximately 36%, reflecting strong revenue growth and ongoing cost discipline. GAAP operating margins increased by 6 percentage points to approximately 20%. We delivered record second quarter free cash flow of $246 million, up 32% year over year, reflecting strong billings growth in both Q1 and Q2.
As we look ahead and as with previous quarters, our fiscal '23 guidance assumes that market conditions remain consistent for the remainder of fiscal '23. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the quarter generated slight incremental FX headwinds, which reduced full year billings, revenue, and free cash flow by approximately $20 million, $5 million, and $5 million, respectively. Bringing these factors together, the overall headline for guidance is that it is unchanged at the midpoint across all metrics, with the underlying momentum of the business offsetting those incremental FX headwinds.
We are narrowing the fiscal '23 revenue range to be between $4.99 billion and $5.04 billion. We continue to expect non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 36% and free cash flow to be between $2 billion and $2.08 billion. The slide deck and updated Excel financials on our website have more details on modeling assumptions for Q3 and full year fiscal '23. While the challenges our customers face are changing, the growth drivers underpinning our strategy have only been reinforced, which gives us confidence in our long-term growth potential.
Thank you, Debbie. Our strategy is to transform the industries we serve with end-to-end cloud-based solutions that drive efficiency and sustainability for our customers. Our business is scalable and extensible into adjacent vertical, from architecture and engineering through construction and operations, from product engineering to product data management and product manufacturing. It is also scalable and extensible between verticals, with industrialized construction, and into new workflows like XR.
The Indiana Department of Transportation, which was looking for an efficient solution to simplify its document management and field collaboration, is another good Q2 example. By adopting Autodesk Build and ACC Connect, it will improve communication and coordination throughout the construction process and streamline the documentation of citizen issues, resulting in less waste and more return per taxpayer dollar. Across construction, the industry continues to look to connect workflows from planning and design to preconstruction, construction, and ultimately, operations and maintenance. And we are enabling our customers to connect those workflows on a single platform.
For Autodesk, it adds a significant new persona group to Fusion's addressable market opportunity. In automotive, we continue to grow our footprint beyond the design studio into manufacturing as automotive OEMs seek to break down the work silos and shorten the handoff and design cycles. For example, a top-tier commercial vehicle manufacturer renewed and increased its partnership with Autodesk as part of its strategic focus on building a sustainable product and service portfolio, which leverages new technologies and digital innovation to accelerate electrical vehicle solutions. In addition to Alias, which it already uses for surfacing work of all its vehicles, it is utilizing VR technology from the wild in combination with VRED and Navisworks to drive innovation and visualization from design and engineering through factory design.
Our Fusion 360 platform approach enables customers to seamlessly connect workflows and push the boundaries of innovation through the advanced design and manufacturing technologies and extensions. For example, a global leader in seat manufacturing, which works with many major automakers worldwide, engaged Autodesk Consulting to develop a blended workflow across design, product engineering, and manufacturing. The result was a seat that proves passenger comfort and safety while reducing the weight and number of parts. Using Autodesk design tools like Alias Conceptual Design and Fusion 360 design, it was able to redefine the seat design with thinner seat sections and improved comfort and safety.
During the quarter, we closed seven deals over $500,000 with our license compliance initiatives, three of which were over $1 million. Flex and Premium are also helping customers transition from multiuser to named user contracts. A leading supplier of concrete formwork and scaffolding systems in Europe has been unifying internally around BIM to accelerate its digital transformation. It added Premium plan to its transitions and named trade-ins to centralize software management, enable user-based analytics and license optimization and benefit from single sign-on security.
It can also purchase Flex token to cover its occasional user needs. Let me finish where I started. Strong demand and robust competitive performance delivered excellent Q2 results. Our subscription business continues to demonstrate its growth potential and resilience.
By accelerating the convergence of workflows within and between the industries we serve, we are accelerating the digital transformation of our customers and creating broader and deeper partnerships with them. And by moving from products to platforms and capabilities and bringing those capabilities to any device anywhere through the cloud, we are expanding our opportunity horizon. Look for us to talk more about that over the coming weeks, months, and years. We look forward to seeing many of you at Autodesk University in a few weeks.",16.0,Negligible

During this call, we may make forward-looking statements about our outlook, future results and related assumptions, acquisitions, products, and product capabilities and strategies.

Thank you, Simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. We again reported record third quarter revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, and free cash flow. Encouragingly, the business is performing as we'd expect given secular growth tailwinds and macroeconomic, geopolitical policy, and COVID-19-related headwinds. Subscription renewal rates remain resilient.
Our competitive performance remains strong. Outside of Russia and China, new business growth slightly decelerated in the quarter, most notably in Europe, but overall growth remains good. And we see less demand for multiyear upfront and more demand for annual contracts than we expected. We're hopeful this is a positive signal for our transition next year to annual billings for multiyear contracts.
And bid activity on BuildingConnected remains robust as the industry continues to work through its backlog. We are reinforcing the secular tailwinds to our business by accelerating the convergence of workflows within and between the industries we serve, creating broader and deeper partnerships with existing customers, and bringing new customers into our ecosystem. Our strategy is underpinned by disciplined and focused investments through the economic cycle, which enables Autodesk to remain well-invested to realize the significant benefits of its strategy while mitigating the risk of having to make expensive catch-up investments later. In September, we hosted more than 10,000 customers and partners at Autodesk University.
I will now turn the call over to Debbie to take you through our third quarter financial performance and guidance for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. I'll then come back to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives. 
Thanks, Andrew. In a more challenging macroeconomic environment, Autodesk performed in line with our expectations in the third quarter, excluding the impact of in-quarter currency movements on revenue. Resilient subscription renewal rates, healthy new business growth, and a strong competitive performance were partly offset by geopolitical macroeconomic policy, and COVID-19-related headwinds, foreign exchange movements, and less demand for multiyear upfront and more demand for annual contracts than we expected. Total revenue grew 14% and 15% at constant exchange rates.
Total RPO of $4.7 billion and current RPO of $3.1 billion grew 11% and 9%, respectively. At constant exchange rates, RPO and current RPO grew approximately 15% and 13%, respectively. Turning to the P&L. Non-GAAP gross margin remained broadly level at 93%, while non-GAAP operating margin increased by 4 percentage points to approximately 36%, reflecting strong revenue growth and ongoing cost discipline.
Now let me finish with guidance. Andrew gave you a readout on the business and our markets at the beginning of the call. Our renewal business continues to be a highlight, reflecting the ongoing importance of our software in helping our customers achieve their goals. New business growth continues to be relatively stronger in North America with growth in EMEA and APAC outside of Russia and China, slightly decelerating, but overall growth remains good.
And we've seen less demand for multiyear upfront and more demand for annual contracts than we expected. As we look ahead and as we've done in the past, our Q4 and fiscal '23 guidance assumes that market conditions remain consistent with what we saw as we exited Q3. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the quarter generated slight incremental FX headwinds, reducing full year billings and revenue by approximately $10 million and $5 million, respectively, for the remainder of fiscal '23.
And we expect free cash flow to be between $1.9 billion and $1.98 billion. The slide deck and updated Excel financials on our website have more details on modeling assumptions for the full year of fiscal '23. The challenges our customers face continue to evolve that reinforce the need for digital transformation, which gives us confidence in our long-term growth potential. We continue to target double-digit revenue growth, non-GAAP operating margins in the 38% to 40% range, and double-digit free cash flow growth on a compound annual basis.
Thank you, Debbie. Our strategy is to transform the industries we serve with end-to-end cloud-based solutions that drive efficiency and sustainability for our customers. Fusion, Forma, and Flow connect data, teams, and workflows in the cloud on our trusted platform, making Autodesk rapidly scalable and extensible into adjacent verticals from architectural and engineering to construction and operations, from product engineering to product data management and product manufacturing. Our platform is also scalable and extensible between verticals with industrialized construction and into new workflows like XR.
By accelerating the convergence of workflows within and between the industries we serve, we are also creating broader and deeper partnerships with existing customers and bringing new customers into our ecosystem. In AEC, our customers continue to digitally transform their workflows to win new business and become more efficient and sustainable. For example, to support the city of Chongqing smart city ambitions, the Chongqing Architectural Design Institute, which operates across architecture, municipal engineering, and city planning, is standardizing on AEC collections and developing features to Revit APIs, which automate modeling, drawings, and specification inspection. These will leverage the Design Institute's expertise in BIM and enable faster and higher quality design, reduce error, and waste during construction and build the digital twins for post-construction operation and maintenance.
For example, to transform the speed, efficiency, and sustainability of its network, one of the leading electricity network operators in Europe is accelerating its transformation from 2D to BIM and digital twins. In the third quarter, it signed its first EBA with Autodesk, adding Revit and Docs to enable it to upgrade the capacity of its substations and incorporate renewable power generation rapidly and safely. To accelerate maintenance workflows and reduce costs, the customer is in-sourcing the production of maintenance parts and using Fusion 360 as a platform for 3D printing. Turning to manufacturing.
Over the last few years, it accelerated its cloud strategy by replacing a competitor's on-premise PLM solution with an integrated Vault and Fusion 360-managed solutions and improve the security of its data, enables seamless collaboration between product design and manufacturing and more easily onboard and integrate acquisitions. In Q3, it took another step in its digital transformation by firstly transitioning to named users and adding premium for better usage reporting, insights, and single sign-on security. And secondly, by adding Flex to optimize consumption for its occasional users. Heineken is on a mission to become the best-connected brewer as part of its evergreen strategy and is undergoing a digital transformation to ensure is prepared for the unforeseen challenges in an ever-changing world.
To help, Autodesk has been supporting Heineken's 3D printing initiative with an expanded adoption of Fusion 360 across a number of breweries. By designing and manufacturing their own equipment parts in-house, Heineken has been able to see a reduction in the replacement times of a number of parts from over six weeks to just four hours, significantly reducing downtime and lessening the carbon impact of shipping new parts when necessary. Scanship AS, a Vow Group company is a great example of how our customers are using our Fusion platform to generate sustainable outcomes efficiently and transparently for customers. It has developed technology that processes waste and purified wastewater providing valuable, sustainable, and circular resources and clean energy to a wide range of customers.
Students used the latest workflows and technologies from Fusion 360 and Autodesk Construction Cloud to compete in vocational disciplines such as mechanical engineering, additive manufacturing, and digital construction. Sit Shun Le from Singapore, who won the gold medal for additive manufacturing, used Fusion 360 to find the optimum structure and then minimize the amount of materials used through additive manufacturing. All participants were able to hone their skills using next-generation technology. I'm inspired by their ingenuity and optimistic about the innovation they will bring to the workforce of the future.",16.0,Negligible
AIG,2022,1,"Thanks very much, Jake. Good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations.
Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review our first-quarter financial results. I'm very pleased to report that AIG had an excellent start to 2022. We are successfully executing on several strategic, operational, and financial priorities, and our team has significant momentum on many fronts, which we believe will continue throughout the year. Following my remarks, Shane will provide more detail on our financial results, and then we will take questions.
While we know it will take time for the full impact of the Russia-Ukraine situation to emerge, based on the work we did in the first quarter to analyze our exposures and review known claims, we do not believe the impact will be material to AIG. And in the event of losses, we have multiple reinsurance programs available. With respect to the industry more broadly, there's not been much discussion so far in this earnings season regarding what the Russia-Ukraine situation means. So I thought I'd spend a few minutes on the complexity that it presents.
These sanctions generally required airline lessors to cancel leases with Russian airline operators and gave them a brief period in which to do so. Additionally, we know that there was an aircraft reregistration law passed in Russia on March 14, which permitted Russian airline operators to reregister aircraft leased from Western lessors on the Russian aircraft registry. What we don't know is much more expansive. As an initial matter, we don't know whether or to what extent actual losses have occurred or when they occurred, given the uncertainties surrounding the location and condition of aircraft and other equipment as well as the timing of their potential return to lessors, nor do we know if efforts have been undertaken by lessors to mitigate any damages.
With respect to reinsurance, structures likely implicated in a war peril scenario include war, marine and energy, and political violence, but it's also possible that other types of reinsurance contracts could be available for recoveries. If a loss is alleged to be due to a non-war peril, it could be covered in an all-risk policy. As an initial matter, however, a determination would need to be made that a loss in fact has occurred and then, if it has, that is due to a non-war peril. Additionally, as with war perils, you would have to consider if reinsurance is available.
The reinsurance that would be typically available in all risk scenario may be in different structures than in government confiscation or other war peril scenario. As to all potentially covered perils, there are many issues requiring analysis including the potential applicability of any sanctions. Assuming claim payments are made, insurers will also have to consider their recovery rights through salvage subrogation and contribution from other available insurance. This is just a high-level summary of some of the issues the industry will grapple with, but I thought they were important to highlight, and you get the idea that it's a complex situation.
In life retirement, first-quarter results benefited from product diversity despite headwinds in the capital markets. Return on adjusted segment common equity was 10%. AIG ended the first quarter with $9.1 billion in parent liquidity after returning $1.7 billion to shareholders through $1.4 billion of common stock repurchases and $265 million of dividends. Now let me provide more detail on our first-quarter results in general insurance, where we continue to drive improved financial performance with core fundamentals being key contributors.
Gross premiums written increased 10% on an FX-adjusted basis to $11.5 billion with commercial growing 11% and personal growing 8%. Net premiums written increased 5% on an FX-adjusted basis to $6.5 billion. This growth was led by our commercial business, which grew 8% with personal contracting 1%. Growth in North America commercial net premiums written was 6% and then international net premiums written growth was 10%, both on an FX-adjusted basis.
I'd like to unpack certain components of North America commercial net premiums written as we had a very strong growth in our core business that may not be immediately obvious. While there are always movements each quarter in various aspects of our portfolio, both positive and negative, there were three items that impacted the first quarter that I'd like to provide more insight on. These items relate to assumed and ceded reinsurance and the timing of purchases, which is not something we have focused on previously but which I think is worth spending a few minutes on given the impact they had on North America commercial net premiums written. The first item relates to AIG Re, our assumed reinsurance business.
Financial results for AIG Re are included in the financial results for North America commercial and, in the first quarter, represented 40% of the segment's total net premiums rent. For AIG Re, the first quarter is the largest quarter of the year with over 50% of its annual business written at 1/1. In the first quarter of 2022, AIG Re's net premiums written were flat year over year. This result was deliberate as we applied a disciplined approach to underwriting and the market environment that persisted leading up to 1/1 led us to conclude that AIG Re could not achieve appropriate levels of risk-adjusted returns in property cat, in particular, even with a comprehensive retrocessional program in place.
Third, a similar dynamic occurred with respect to our core property cat reinsurance program for AIG. In 2021, we purchased reinsurance throughout the year to lower net retentions and reduce volatility, particularly with respect to North America property cat. In 2022, however, those purchases were also consolidated into our core property cat placement at 1/1. We were able to consolidate these reinsurance purchases because our portfolio is much improved from last year with significantly reduced exposures.
Like the actions we took in AIG Re, however, this reduced North America commercial net premiums written in the first quarter. To summarize, some of these headwinds in the first quarter of 2022 will largely reverse in the second quarter. Now turning back to growth. In North America commercial, we saw a very strong growth in net premiums written, particularly in retail property, which grew more than 20%; crop risk services, which also grew more than 20%; Lexington wholesale, which grew more than 15% led by property, which grew more than 50%; and our Canadian commercial business, which grew more than 15%.
Strong momentum continued in global commercial with overall rate increases of 9% or 10% if you exclude workers' compensation. And in the aggregate, rate continued to exceed loss cost trends. This continues to be a market in which we are achieving rate on rate in many cases for the fourth consecutive year and where we're successfully driving margin expansion above loss cost trends. North America commercial achieved 8% rate increases overall, 10% excluding workers' compensation with some areas achieving double-digit increases led by retail property, which increased 14%; Lexington, which increased 13%; financial lines, which increased 12%, including more than 85% rate increases in cyber; and Canada, where rate increased 13%, representing the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit rate increases in this region.
International commercial rate increases were 10% overall driven by financial lines, which increased 21%, including more than 60% rate increases in cyber; property, which increased 14%; EMEA, which also increased 14%; and Asia Pac, which increased 10%. Last quarter, we indicated that our severity trend view in the aggregate in North America commercial range from 4% to 5% and that we were migrating toward the upper end of that range. We now believe the upper end is moving toward 5.5% mostly driven by shorter tail lines. Our property rate changes, where we continue to achieve mid-teen increases, equal or exceed loss cost trends in our own data and in government-published inflationary indices.
Our liability trend assumptions continue to be in the 7% to 9% range with international indications continuing to be less than those in North America. Turning to personal lines. In North America, personal net premiums written grew nearly 40%, albeit off a smaller base driven by a rebound in travel and A&H, which was offset by a reduction in warranty and increased reinsurance sessions supporting private client group. International personal saw a 5% reduction in net premiums written on an FX-adjusted basis, due to a reduction in warranty and personal auto in Japan offset by a rebound in A&H and travel.
Overall, personal lines is an area where we continue to invest where there are attractive opportunities for profitable growth. Now let me review life retirement's results. This business had a good quarter considering the headwinds created by the capital markets. These market dynamics were offset by continued strong alternative investment income and strong growth in premiums and deposits, which increased 13% year over year to $7.3 billion.
With respect to capital management, we had a very active first quarter, which ended with $9.1 billion in parent liquidity. As a result of the actions I outlined earlier in my remarks, AIG received $6.5 billion of the $8.3 billion promissory note issued to AIG from Corebridge, and those funds were used to repay outstanding AIG debt, resulting in AIG's interest expense being reduced by 23% year over year. In addition, AIG will receive the remaining $1.9 billion under the Corebridge promissory note during the second quarter. Our capital management strategy will continue to be both balanced and disciplined as we maintain appropriate levels of debt while returning capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends while also allowing for investment in growth opportunities across our global portfolio.
With respect to growth opportunities, our priorities continue to be focused on allocating capital in general insurance, where we see opportunities for profitable organic growth and further improvement in our risk-adjusted returns. As we move through 2022 and are further along with the separation of life retirement, we will provide updates regarding our capital management strategy. Before I turn the call over to Shane, I want to emphasize how pleased I am with how we started the year across AIG and how we are continuing to execute on multiple complex strategic priorities with high-quality results that are positioning AIG as a top-performing company. Our teams have overperformed across the board, and our deep bench continues to provide us with opportunities to leverage skill sets and further develop talent across the organization.
I will then touch upon the balance sheet, leverage, and liquidity, which benefited from excellent execution on a number of capital transactions. I will then supplement Peter's remarks on the separation of Corebridge, including the arrangement we announced with BlackRock and liability management actions we recently completed. I will then spend some time on investment income and will provide insight on the impact of rising interest rates. And finally, I will talk about the execution path toward our long-term 10% ROCE goal for including income drivers, AIG 200, and other areas of corporate GOE reduction.
As Peter mentioned, adjusted EPS attributable to AIG common shareholders grew 24% year over year to $1.30 per diluted common share compared to $1.05 per diluted common share in one quarter '21. Compared to the first quarter '21, improvements in general insurance contributed $0.33 year over year. Reduction in share count contributed $0.07 and lower interest expense contributed $0.04 and offset by life and retirement being $0.19 unfavorable primarily due to $0.20 unfavorable due to lower net investment income. General insurance's adjusted pre-tax income contribution in the quarter was $1.2 billion, which reflects strong underwriting profit, growth in global commercial and continued improvement in both the GAAP combined ratio up 590 basis points to 92.9% and the accident year combined ratio x cat improving 290 basis points to 89.5%.
Within individual retirement, excluding the retail mutual fund business, which was sold, net flows were positive $874 million this quarter compared to positive net flows of $50 million in the prior-year quarter. benefiting from higher fixed annuity sales aided by origination activity through the Blackstone partnership. Group Retirement grew deposits by 3.9% in the quarter driven by higher group acquisitions and individual deposits driving a slight uptick in fee and advisory income due to higher assets under administration. Life insurance adjusted pre-tax income was a loss of $44 million due to continued elevated COVID mortality, while premium and deposits grew 3.4% to $1.2 billion benefiting from growth of international life sales.
Institutional markets grew premiums and deposits as well as reserves due to increased pension risk transfer activity in the period. Turning to other operations, which includes interest expense, corporate general operating expenses, institutional asset management expense, runoff portfolios, and eliminations and was a positive contributor to adjusted pre-tax income year over year by $109 million. These results benefited from lower interest expense of $51 million as we reduced our general borrowings through the course of 2021 by $4 billion and lower eliminations of $43 million. Corporate general and operating expenses, excluding increased functional costs to set up Corebridge as a stand-alone public company of $6 million, were largely flat year over year.
Moving on to the balance sheet, leverage, and liquidity. Our financial flexibility remains strong. We closed the quarter with $9.1 billion of parent liquidity. We saw a large AOCI movement as a result of increase in interest rates.
Adjusted AOCI, which excludes the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude, moved from $3.9 billion positive to a $5.9 billion negative or a reduction of $9.8 billion. Although this mark-to-market impact is a drag on capital, as long as we hold the assets to maturity, we will not realize this unrealized loss. Operating interest rate movements impact our metrics primarily in two places. One, we end up with a gain on the Fortitude Re embedded derivative, which impacted GAAP EPS by $3.21 in the quarter.
And second, it impacts our GAAP leverage by a little over 300 basis points. And with interest rates up another 55 basis points in April, we expect to see further movement in Q2. We exited the quarter at a GAAP leverage of 27.8%, up from 24.6%, the increase of which is attributable to the AOCI movement. The impact is larger in life and retirement than general insurance given the duration of their respective asset portfolios.
Total adjusted return on common equity was 7.6%, up from 7.4% in the first quarter '21. And total company adjusted tangible return on common equity was 8.3%. general insurance's adjusted attributable return on common equity was 12.3% in the first quarter, while life and retirement was 10%. Adjusted book value per share of $70.72 increased 2.7% sequentially and 20.5% year-over-year.
Adjusted tangible book value per share of $64.65 increased 2.9% sequentially and 22.3% year over year. Our primary operating subsidiaries remain profitable and well-capitalized with general insurance's U.S. pool fleet risk-based capital ratio for the first quarter estimated to be between 470% and 480%, and the life and retirement U.S. fleet is estimated to be between 430% and 440%, both well above our target ranges.
Finally, on EPS during the quarter, we repurchased 23 million shares at an average cost of $60.02 for $1.4 billion, bringing our ending share count to $800 million with a quarterly average of $826 million, compared to $876 million in the prior-year quarter representing a 6% reduction in average share count, which contributed $0.07 of EPS growth in the quarter. Turning to Corebridge. Since the start of the year, we continue to make progress on numerous fronts with respect to the separation. As Peter mentioned, at the end of the first quarter, Corebridge entered into a strategic partnership with BlackRock to manage up to $90 billion of liquid assets.
At the same time, AIG also entered into a separate arrangement with BlackRock, whereby BlackRock will manage liquid assets for AIG representing up to $60 billion. Having now signed IMAs, we expect to begin transferring assets to BlackRock over the course of the second quarter. In early April, Corebridge successfully raised $6.5 billion of senior notes, which, along with the remaining $2.5 billion of delayed draw term loan facility and commitments for the $2.5 billion of revolving credit facility, this establishes the capital structure for Corebridge Financial. AIG proactively hedged treasury rates earlier in the year, and upon unwinding the hedge at quarter end, AIG realized a $223 million gain, which equates to approximately 50 basis points in yield on the notes issued.
While the debt issuance closed early in Q2, the $223 million gain was realized as a gain in the first quarter. The senior notes offering, excluding the hedge, was well structured and laddered with a 3.91% weighted average coupon rate. Corebridge used the proceeds from that offering to repay $6.4 billion of the $8.3 billion promissory note payable to AIG. Following the success of Corebridge's senior notes issuance, AIG initiated a debt tender offer.
Taking advantage of strong demand, the tender offer was upsized, and AIG parent debt was ultimately reduced by $6.8 billion. An additional EUR 750 million will be redeemed on May 10, bringing the total expected AIG parent debt reduction to $7.6 billion. The average coupon on the debt that we retired was 3.82% and the annualized interest expense savings is approximately $290 million. We continue to target debt leverage in the high 20s, excluding AOCI for Corebridge; and in the low 20s, including AOCI for AIG going forward.
The first quarter saw significant increases in benchmark treasury yields with an 80 basis point increase on the 10-year. With general insurance and life and retirement portfolio durations of4 and 8.4 years, respectively, the overall rising interest rate environment will provide a tailwind to our investment portfolio returns. In April, our portfolio crossed the equilibrium point where new money yield is now 50 basis points higher on average than the yield on the assets rolling off the portfolio. The new money yield is higher by 20 basis points in general insurance versus assets rolling off and 70 basis points in life and retirement versus the yield on sales and maturities currently.
Moving forward, the new money yield is roughly 60 basis points higher than the current portfolio in general insurance and roughly 90 basis points higher in life and retirement. To illustrate the point, holding all other variables constant and assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, we would anticipate approximately $500 million of benefit to adjusted net investment income over a one-year period with nearly $200 million in general insurance and $300 million in life and retirement. Within general insurance, we have $11 billion of floating-rate securities, which will begin to see some benefits in the near term, most of which are not tied to longer-dated liabilities. life and retirement is $25 billion of floating-rate assets, but most of this portfolio is tied to floating rate liabilities that will offset the benefits.
Turning to investments that have Russian exposure. At December 31, AIG held $359 million of sovereign and other foreign debt of the Russian Federation, of which $79 million were within Fortitude. Through proactive sell-downs of $129 million, which generated a loss of $41 million as well as the establishment of a credit allowance of $127 million, the market value of these securities at the end of the first quarter was $86 million, of which $18 million is held by Fortitude. Looking ahead, we have three priorities beyond continued progress on underwriting optimization and completing AIG 200.",25.0,
AIG,2022,2,"Thanks very much, and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially.
Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter results. AIG had an excellent quarter with strong momentum continuing across all of our strategic, financial, and operational objectives. I could not be more pleased with the exceptional results in general insurance. And life and retirement again delivered good results despite very challenging equity market conditions, significant volatility, and other headwinds.
Consistent with our strategy to manage volatility, catastrophe losses were very modest in the quarter, coming in at $121 million or 1.8% of a combined ratio. Life and retirement has strong fixed annuity sales with over $1.3 billion in deposits for the second straight quarter, which benefited from the origination capabilities of Blackstone. AIG returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders in the second quarter through $1.7 billion of common stock repurchases and $256 million of dividends. In addition, we are on track to buy back at least $1 billion of common stock in the third quarter.
Second, as a follow-on to the IPO discussion, I will review life and retirement results where, as I mentioned, the core business showed continued resilience and solid performance despite headwinds largely driven from a reduction in net investment income. Third, I will review the performance of general insurance, where underwriting excellence continues to produce outstanding results with strong profitability and top-line growth, particularly in our global commercial portfolio. Fourth, I will provide an update on AIG 200, where we achieved critical milestones and delivered on our stated goal of $1 billion in exit run rate savings six months ahead of schedule. Lastly, I'll provide an update on capital management, particularly with respect to stock buybacks and debt reduction.
Following my remarks, Shane will provide more detail on the quarter and then we will take questions. Mark Lyons, David McElroy, and Kevin Hogan will join us for the Q&A portion of today's call. As you can see, our team has accomplished a lot on many fronts. Before expanding on our financial and operating performance, I want to address the status of the Corebridge IPO.
Our base case had always been to complete the IPO in the second quarter, subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions. In deciding whether to launch the initial public offering in May or June, we weighed several variables, which were all market-related, some specific to Corebridge and some more macro level. These included equity market conditions and particularly the trading values of companies in the life and retirement sector that we consider to be the most comparable to Corebridge. In the second quarter, equity markets were down 16% with only three weeks seeing positive market returns, the VIX, which was above 30 resulting in extremely elevated market volatility and feedback we received from advisors, analysts, and many potential institutional investors following the public filing of the S-1.
While completing the IPO is a significant priority for us and something we are laser-focused on, we believe this is an attractive business and did not want to execute a transaction that would be detrimental to stakeholders in the long run. Absent something we don't see today, we remain ready to execute on the IPO, subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions. And the next window will be in September. In the meantime, throughout the summer, we continue to make significant progress to position the business for long-term success.
This includes our strategic partnership with Blackstone announced in July of 2021 and our partnership with BlackRock, where we began moving assets under management in the second quarter of this year pursuant to the arrangement we announced in late March. And three, planning our transition to BlackRock's Aladdin platform, which will replace aging and end-of-life technology infrastructure and provide enhanced risk analytics and reporting. We continue to expect that Corebridge will pay an annual dividend of $600 million post-IPO that will have a payout ratio of 60% to 65%, and that it will achieve a return on equity of 12% to 14% over the next 24 months. Now turning to life and retirement's performance in the second quarter.
Second quarter deposits of $1.8 billion were strong with base net investment spread growing 4 basis points sequentially due to the higher interest rate environment. The life and retirement balance sheet and capital position remains strong with an RBC ratio of 415% to 425%, still above our target ranges. Now let me provide more detail on our second quarter results in general insurance, where we continue to drive improved financial performance. Gross premiums written increased 5% on an FX-adjusted basis to $9.6 billion, with global commercial growing 8% and global personal decreasing 3%.
Net premiums written increased 5% on an FX-adjusted basis to $6.9 billion. This growth was led by our global commercial business, which grew 8% with global personal decreasing 4%. Global commercial net premiums written increased 10%, excluding AIG Re, where we have significantly reduced property CAT writings and exposure, particularly in the Southeast region of the U.S. North America commercial net premiums written increased 10% or 14% excluding AIG Re.
And international net premiums written increased 5% or 8% excluding the impact of nonrenewal and cancellations related to Russia exposure in each case on an FX-adjusted basis. In North America commercial, we saw very strong growth in net premiums written: In Lexington, which grew 31% led by wholesale property, which was up 46%; retail property, which grew 17%; and our Canadian commercial business, which grew 10%. In international commercial, on an FX-adjusted basis, we also saw strong growth in net premiums written: In Global Specialty, which grew 16% led by energy, which was up 20%; and marine, which was up 10%; North America Specialty, which grew 17%; and international Specialty, which grew 15%. In global commercial, we also had very strong renewal retention of 85% in our in-force portfolio, with North America up 200 basis points to 85% and international holding steady at a very strong 86%.
Turning to rate. Momentum continued in global commercial with overall rate increases of 7%. And in the aggregate, rate continued to exceed loss cost trends. This is the fourth consecutive year in which we're achieving rate above loss cost trends and where we are successfully driving margin expansion.
North America commercial achieved 7% rate increases with some areas achieving double-digit increases led by Lexington, which increased 18% with 17% in Lexington wholesale property; Financial Lines, where professional increased 34% led by cyber, which increased 52%; and excess casualty, which increased 10%. International commercial rate increases were 7% driven by Financial Lines, which increased 11%, including more than 47% rate increases in cyber; property, which increased 10%; and EMEA, which also increased 10%. Last quarter, we indicated that our loss cost trend view in the aggregate for North America commercial had migrated upwards from 4% to 5%, mostly driven by shorter tail lines. And as a result, we moved the upper end of the range to 5.5%.
In the second quarter, trends in casualty and other liability lines continue to show no obvious impact in either internal or external data to support a large move on loss cost, whereas property businesses have been more clearly affected. As a result, based on a review of more recent information, we again modified our view on loss cost trend to 6%. Loss cost trend represents the composite of frequency and severity. However, there is an additional mitigant to inflation built into rate decisions.
Exposure trend, which we view as a partial offset to loss cost trend, reflects the additional premiums an insurer receives driven by growth in underlying inflation sensitive exposure basis. When taking this exposure mitigant into account, our current North America commercial loss cost trend net of these inflationary exposure benefits is approximately 4%. Additionally, our North America commercial accident year loss ratio, ex CAT, is booked at 63% year to date, which is consistent with pure actuarial rate over loss cost and exposure trends but is a pure numerical approach and does not reflect our improved risk selection and continued improvement in terms of conditions. Those benefits will emerge over time.
As we discussed on prior calls, since 2018, we have implemented a clear ventilation strategy in our casualty, financial lines and property portfolios that directs our capacity deployment toward higher average attachment points, which is a strong defensive measure toward rising inflation. And this strategy continues today. We also implemented the strategy in our AIG risk management loss-sensitive workers' compensation business. And over the last few years, average deductibles have increased 30% to $1.3 million.
Currently, the level of reinsurance we purchased and the commensurate model ceded profit is a headwind to net premiums written growth and combined ratio improvement. This has been intentional as we are not willing to take volatility on frequency or tail risk on CAT in our high net worth business. Adding to this, the inability to pass on increased loss and reinsurance costs through rate increases or limit management largely due to regulatory constraints further deteriorates margin in the short run. But we have made a deliberate decision to continue writing this business as we believe the trade-off is appropriate in the near term given the opportunity we see over the long term.
And while each of our CAT-exposed businesses has different attributes, I don't see reinsurance costs for the high net worth market generally becoming less expensive for the foreseeable future, but instead, seeing it putting pressure on the segment. In fact, for a business that is primarily underwritten in peak zones with high total insured values, reinsurance costs will likely increase and, in some cases, materially. To understand the complexity of reinsurance for peak zones, you need to look no further than in what has happened in the retrocessional market over the last few years. While overall small market, retrocession provides approximately $60 billion of available limit across various structures, of which roughly $20 billion is indemnity-based for reinsurers with this capacity primarily supported by alternative capital.
The dynamics in the retrocessional market over the last few years are important to understand because they have materially changed even though overall retrocessional capacity has remained flat since 2017. First, the cost of retrocession has increased significantly more than in the reinsurance industry on a risk-adjusted basis. Second, available capacity has shifted from predominantly aggregate to predominantly occurrence. Third, first event aggregate and lower attaching occurrence retrocession have been put under significant stress.
Fourth, the retrocessional market return period attachment points have increased 50%. And fifth, compounded risk-adjusted rate changes have also increased by over 50%, even though retrocessional exposure is reduced compared to prior year. When you couple these factors with the additional adjustments going forward for inflation, model changes, trapped capital, you have a very complicated and challenging market. Additionally, if you review global insured net cat retrocessional losses over the last decade, nine out of 10 years have had larger contributions from secondary peril aggregate losses than peak peril losses, which highlights the complexity of modeling catastrophes.
As a result of these dynamics and challenging circumstances, we concluded that to continue to provide high-net-worth clients with comprehensive solutions that meet their emerging risk issues, we needed to move property homeowners product to the non-admitted market, particularly in CAT-exposed states. In the second quarter, we exited the admitted personal property homeowners market in certain states as we could no longer maintain our level of aggregation especially given the inability to reflect the loss cost increases, inflation and increased reinsurance costs and rates as well as limitations on our ability to make coverage changes in this market. As part of our go-forward high net worth strategy, we're going to move homeowners and possibly other products in more states to the non-admitted market. And we plan to set up a structure that, over time, we expect to be supported by third-party capital providers in addition to AIG.
The claims we have received continue to be largely reported under political violence or political risk policies. And we continue to reserve our best estimate of ultimate losses, heavily comprised of IBNR despite the fact that the information we have received in connection with these claims remains very limited. Moreover, in the event of losses and the lines of business we have outlined that are subject to a potential loss, we have multiple reinsurance programs available. Turning to AIG 200.
As I said earlier, we had a very successful second quarter where we reduced net debt outstanding by $1.4 billion, repurchased $1.7 billion of common stock, paid $256 million in dividends, and ended with $5.6 billion in parent liquidity. Looking ahead, with respect to debt repayment, AIG will receive the remaining $1.9 billion under the promissory note from life and retirement prior to the IPO. And we expect to use these proceeds to pay down additional AIG debt and for other purposes. With respect to share buybacks, we have $5.8 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization and expect to repurchase at least $1 billion of common stock in the third quarter.
I will then review our balance sheet, leverage, AOCI, liquidity and share count, which benefited from excellent execution on a number of capital transactions. And finally, I want to provide you more detail on the execution path to 10% ROCE for AIG and more detail on what we intend to do to get there, including income drivers, expense reduction, and AIG 200 where, as Peter noted, we have contracted or executed on our stated goal of $1 billion of exit run rate savings 6 months ahead of our original time line. Turning to EPS. Adjusted after-tax EPS was $1.19 per diluted common share.
Improvements in general insurance profit of $1.26 billion contributed $0.06 year over year. Within general insurance, strong underwriting income of $799 million contributed $0.31 of improvement, offset by a $0.25 decline in net investment income primarily driven by the decline in alternatives. And reduction in shares outstanding also contributed $0.10. Life and retirement declined $0.52 in APTI to $563 million, which was below last year's second quarter primarily due to $0.36 or $387 million unfavorable from lower net investment income, $0.19 or $202 million from accelerated DAC amortization and an increased SOP 03-1 reserves.
International personal experienced a 120 basis points deterioration in the accident year combined ratio ex CAT, coming in at 95.2% for the second quarter. In the second quarter, CAT losses were $121 million or 1.8 loss ratio points, compared to $138 million or 2.1 loss ratio points in the prior-year quarter. Prior-year development, excluding related premium adjustments, was $202 million favorable this quarter compared to the favorable development of $51 million in the prior-year quarter. This quarter, the ADC amortization provided $42 million of favorable development.
And the balance of $160 million favorable arose mostly from old accident years in workers' compensation along with primary casualty lines in the U.S. The review in the quarter was mainly focused on North America and represents approximately 15% of reserves. Within both AIGRM loss-sensitive work comp and U.S. primary casualty lines, there were additional indications of higher favorable development, but we felt it prudent to wait and see how the inflationary environment evolves, particularly as it relates to the casualty bodily injury and the medical side of workers' comp.
We look at this quarterly, and as is our standard practice, we will be reviewing approximately 75% of the total pre-ADC general insurance reserves in the third quarter. Life and retirement adjusted pre-tax income of $563 million, compared to $1.12 billion in the second quarter of 2021. The year-over-year decline was due to $387 million of lower net investment income, of which $224 million is from lower alternative investment income as well as accelerated DAC and increased SOP reserves of $202 million driven by the market declines in the second quarter. The DAC and SOP charges had approximately 300 basis points negative impact on ROCE in the quarter, but these are largely noncash.
Within individual retirement, fixed annuity sales increased 48% year over year, aided by origination activity to the Blackstone relationship. And fixed index annuity had another solid quarter of sales. Sales of variable annuities declined in the quarter, consistent with market conditions. Net flows were positive $628 million this quarter, compared to negative net flows of $77 million in the prior-year quarter.
And variable and indexed annuity spreads expanded two basis points from the first quarter of 2022. Group retirement had strong deposits in the quarter of $1.8 billion, while surrenders declined and base net investment spread was up four basis points versus the first quarter of 2022. Life insurance adjusted pre-tax income was $117 million. The second quarter represented the lowest COVID mortality quarter since the pandemic began, while non-COVID mortality also ran favorable in the period.
And our projected lapse rates, fund bases and dynamic premium modeling approach are consistent with the recommendations of the study. As additional background, over the last five years, we have been reviewing and strengthening our reserve assumptions for the guaranteed universal life product. And as a result, we don't expect significant adjustments. Turning to other operations, which includes interest expense, corporate general operating expenses, institutional asset management expense, runoff portfolio and eliminations, it was a positive contributor to adjusted pre-tax income year over year by $149 million.
Corporate general operating expenses improved $74 million year over year in the second quarter, benefiting from AIG 200 and continued emphasis on expense management. Adjusted pre-tax net investment income for the quarter was $2.5 billion, a decline of $678 million compared to the second quarter of 2021. As a reminder, we report the results of our private equity holdings on a one-quarter lag, and we may have an impact in the third quarter as well. Over the last few years, we focused on improving the risk profile of the investment portfolio with continued vigilance around corporate and consumer credit and a strong capital and liquidity profile in both general insurance and life and retirement, which support our ability to manage through difficult times as evidenced by our financial stability through COVID.
In life and retirement, our weighted average credit rating has improved since the end of 2015, while the percentage of capital-intensive assets has declined in the portfolio from 10.5% to 8.3%. In the second quarter, we continued the proactive steps in the investment portfolio to avoid potential overexposure in the event credit deteriorates. We sold RMBS and ABS securities with a market value of $3.2 billion in the second quarter. In addition, we have alternative investments, particularly hedge funds, that have generated good returns over time but with more quarter-to-quarter fluctuations and that is more volatility than we would prefer.
Going forward, we would expect to move over time to an asset allocation with less volatility. We've also executed on sales of approximately $4 billion of low-yielding longer-duration corporate bonds to buy higher-yielding, shorter-duration structured securities, privates, ABS, and CMLs with many of them being floaters. We feel it is appropriate to take advantage of the higher rate environment and turn the portfolio over a little more quickly than would naturally occur at maturity, thereby enhancing our forward APTI and ROCE. The second quarter saw significant increases in benchmark treasury yields with a 65 basis point increase on the 10-year or 146 basis points through June 30th.
With general insurance and life and retirement portfolio durations are just under four and eight years, respectively, the overall rising interest rate environment will provide a tailwind to our investment portfolio returns. Our base fixed income portfolio saw a lift in yield of 18 basis points in the second quarter versus first quarter with $17 million additional within general insurance and $28 million additional in life and retirement. The new money yield on our base portfolio was approximately 80 basis points above the assets rolling off the portfolio during the second quarter. At the end of the second quarter, the new money yield is roughly 130 basis points higher than the overall current portfolio in general insurance and roughly 75 basis points higher in life and retirement.
Moving on to the balance sheet, leverage, and liquidity. As Peter noted, we closed the quarter with $5.6 billion of parent liquidity. The second quarter includes execution of $1.7 billion in share repurchases, $256 million of common and preferred dividends and $1.4 billion net spend on debt reduction actions, including AIG debt retirement and extinguishment costs of $7.9 billion that is partially offset by the Corebridge debt issuance of $6.5 billion. In the second quarter, we saw a large AOCI movement as a result of increasing interest rates.
Adjusted AOCI, which excludes the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude, moved from negative $5.9 billion to negative $15.4 billion, or an additional reduction of $9.5 billion. We exited the second quarter with GAAP leverage of 31.1%, up from 27.8%, a 330 basis point increase quarter over quarter. The decrease in AOCI in the period added 390 basis points to the leverage ratio. This was partially offset by the net debt reduction of $1.3 billion in the period in addition to net income gains.
The impact of AOCI is substantially larger in life and retirement and general insurance, given the duration of their respective asset portfolios. At quarter end, our debt leverage ratio, excluding AOCI, was 25.3%, down 60 basis points versus 25.9% at the end of the first quarter of 2022. Total adjusted return on common equity was 7%, down from 10.5% in 2Q '21. And total company adjusted tangible return on common equity was 7.6%.
The decrease is mostly caused by decline in net investment income. general insurance's adjusted attributable return on common equity was 12% in the second quarter while life and retirement was 7.6%. life and retirement's ROCE was impacted by approximately 300 basis point drag from the acceleration of DAC, an increase in the SOP 03-1 reserves in the second quarter. Adjusted book value per share of $72.23 increased 2.1% sequentially and 20.2% year over year.
Adjusted tangible book value per share of $66.06 increased 2.2% sequentially and 21.8% year over year. Our primary operating subsidiaries remain profitable and well capitalized with general insurance's U.S. pool fleet risk-based capital ratio for the second quarter estimated to be between 475% and 485%. And the life and retirement U.S.",25.0,
BBY,2022,1,"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Best Buy's first quarter fiscal '23 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, vice president of investor relations. Please go ahead.
Some of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial condition, business initiatives, growth plans, investments, and expected performance of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's current earnings release and our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am proud of our team's strong execution and focus on providing amazing service for our customers. Throughout the quarter, they navigated the uncertain macro environment and drove higher customer satisfaction scores while keeping energy and excitement going around the initiatives that we believe will drive longer-term opportunities. We grew our Totaltech membership, increased momentum in our health business, launched new product categories, and reached our fastest ever Q1 average online sales delivery speed.
At our investor update in March, we said we expected our fiscal '23 financial results to look different, as we all lap stimulus and other government support, our industry cycles the last two years of unusually strong demand, and we leveraged our position of strength to continue to invest in our future. In addition, we said we expected promotional activity to increase and supply chain expenses to be a pressure. As such, we guided our annual comparable sales to decline 1% to 4% and our non-GAAP operating income rate to decline 60 basis points to approximately 5.4%. Therefore, the drivers of our Q1 financial results were largely as expected.
And we are encouraged by the improvements in our customer net promoter scores. We have been leveraging our omnichannel strength to serve and support our customers as their shopping behavior and expectations have evolved significantly over the past two years. While customers have returned to physical stores to see and touch products and get advice, our digital engagement with customers remains very high. Our online sales as a percentage of domestic sales are 31%, still twice as high as pre-pandemic levels.
Like other companies, we have seen cost inflation in areas, such as labor, marketing, and supply chain. However, this cost inflation was largely in line with our expectations and benefited from planning and execution over the previous two years. As it relates to product pricing, we have seen an increase in our average selling prices over the past two years due to a number of factors. First, our product sales mix has changed, as customers have mix into premium products at higher price points.
This has been happening for years and accelerated during the pandemic. Additionally, we have driven material growth in appliances, which carry high ASPs and have become a larger part of our mix. Second, there was overall lower promotional and markdown activity during much of the pandemic due to the shortage of product to meet demand. And third, our vendors are absorbing higher transportation and component costs, and some of that has led to higher cost of goods sold for us.
In many cases, we have passed through this higher cost of goods sold in the form of higher prices to customers. Importantly and fundamentally, we aim to be competitive in our pricing. We have seen a pickup in the promotional environment, as we have consistently noted, starting in July of last year. As we entered fiscal '23, we expected the promotional environment to create margin pressure in Q1 and throughout the year.
In Q1, we did experience a more promotional environment for many of our products when compared to last year. And some products were even more promotional than we expected coming into the quarter and were similar to pre-pandemic levels. Turning back to our Q1 results. Our ending inventory was up 9% compared to last year and essentially in line with the growth of our revenues since fiscal '20.
We are, of course, not immune to the supply chain challenges in the world today, and we are seeing some impacts on our business. We have invested in many aspects of our supply chain over the last several years in ways that have helped us navigate the environment and mitigate the impacts. We have employed a portfolio approach as it relates to carriers, transportation partners, and parcel delivery partners. And we have built deep relationships across our supply chain, including port carriers and deconsolidation operations.
In addition, we strategically leveraged the use of both rail and over the road transportation modes to move product. All of this has helped us to drive capacity, avoid large scale disruption, and mitigate cost increases. Importantly, our contractual relationships have allowed us to limit our exposure to the more turbulent spot market. The strong relationships we have cultivated with our vendors have also been crucial to our navigation of the supply chain environment.
Working closely with our vendors, we have a great deal of visibility into and can influence the status of product in the supply chain process. Additionally, we actually handled transportation for many of our vendors, meaning we take control in Asia or Mexico. Then we have full visibility and control of the inventory movement and cost. We have invested in our distribution center network, effectively bringing product closer to customers and implementing technology solutions that increase productivity and speed to customer.
We have also invested in our store base fulfillment, including our ship from store customer fulfillment centers, and implemented an effective employee delivery system. These investments have allowed us to make dramatic improvements and speed of delivery to our customers, even with the significant increase in volume in the past two-plus years. In addition, we have many options for our customers to pick up their products themselves through in-store pickup, curbside pickup, lockers, and alternate pickup locations. Customers clearly appreciate the convenience, as the percentage of online sales picked up in stores has remained relatively consistent over the past several years at approximately 40%, even with the incredible improvements in shipping time.
As it relates to ESG, we remain encouraged by the recent recognition of our work to support the environment and our community, both inside and outside Best Buy. We are proud to be included on Ethisphere's 2022 World's Most Ethical Companies list. We are one of only three retailers on it, and it's our eighth time earning the honor. We were also included on the 2022 Forbes list of Best Employers for Diversity as one of the top four retailers on the list.
It's our third consecutive year making the rankings that recognize leadership and commitment toward building a more inclusive workplace. During the quarter, we expanded our recycling program to include a new service for customers who are looking for our help recycling their large products. For a fee, we will go to customers' homes to pick up large electronics and appliances, as well as an unlimited number of small products and ensure they're responsibly recycled and kept out of landfills. This service is an addition to our everyday recycling programs available at all Best Buy stores in our haul-away service with the purchase of new products.
As we provided a more detailed investor update in combination with our Q4 results on March 3rd, I'm not going to outline all our initiatives, but we'd like to provide a few updates on our progress. In March, we spoke quite a bit about Totaltech, our unique membership program that includes member pricing discounts, product protection, free delivery and installation, and 24/7 tech support. Fundamentally, Totaltech is designed to provide our customers with complete confidence in their technology, buying it, getting it up and running, enjoying it, and fixing it if something goes wrong. During the quarter, we continued to sign up more members, as customers realize the great benefits of the program.
This is growing and important, as we continue to see very high customer satisfaction scores and increasing spend by customers who engage with the consultants. We also have a team that is focused on providing tech products and solutions for businesses in specific industries, including home building, hospitality, and healthcare. We have been growing this aspect of our business for several years, and more recent investments in our digital capabilities and fulfillment have led to strong growth momentum that we expect will continue. For example, Q1 revenue from this team was up 15% over last year's Q1 and up more than 70% from Q1 of fiscal '20.
We also continue to see strong results from our outlet stores and are on track to roll out more this year, with new stores opening soon in Chicago, Houston, and Phoenix. Our outlet stores assort open-box, clearance, end-of-life, and otherwise distressed large product inventory in major appliances and televisions that might otherwise be liquidated at significantly lower recovery rate. We tend to see twice the recovery rate of our cost of goods sold when we sell this product at our outlets versus alternative channels. Additionally, these locations can attract new and reengaged customers.
Last year, we estimate that approximately 16% of outlet customers were new to Best Buy and 37% where reengaged Best Buy customers. In fiscal '23, we plan to double the number of outlets by opening 15 additional stores, and we are expanding our assortment beyond major appliances and large TVs to include computing, gaming, and mobile phones. We're already seeing increased performance in these new outlet formats, as customers gravitate to the expanded assortment. Finally, these outlet stores are an important element of our circular economy strategy by providing a second opportunity for products to be resold instead of ending up in the landfill.
And another important element of the circular economy strategy is our trade-in program. We have an extensive trade-in program, covering more major CE categories than anyone else. In Q1, we took in 135,000 trade-in units from customers. Not only does our trade-in program keep tech products out of landfills, our customers typically spend three times the amount they receive on their trade-in on new products at Best Buy.
We are continuing our category expansion strategy as well. For example, we're helping customers commute more sustainably with a new lineup of the best electric bikes, scooters, and mopeds. Over the next 18 months, we'll be bringing a selection of these products to nearly every Best Buy store. We're also rolling out charging devices, perfect for our customers' garages in several stores.
In summary, I am proud of how much we accomplished in the first quarter and excited about what lies ahead for us. Clearly, there remains a great deal of uncertainty. On one hand, consumers still have relatively strong balance sheets. They continue to spend, wages are up, and unemployment is at record lows.
On the other hand, many consumers are lapping stimulus income they received last year and are also facing issues like higher gas and food prices, rising interest and mortgage rates, recession fears, stock market volatility, and geopolitical uncertainty, stemming from the war in Ukraine. Underlying all that is the gradual shifting of spend from stay-at-home purchases to more experiential spend on services and the activities many were unable to enjoy during the pandemic. As I mentioned at the start of my comments, while the drivers of our results were largely as expected, the comparable sales decline of 8% was on the softer side, as inflationary pressures heightened throughout the quarter. That trend has continued into the beginning of Q2, and it does not appear that it will abate in the near term.
Therefore, as Matt will outline, we are revising our guidance and now expect fiscal '23 comparable sales decline in the range of 3% to 6%. And we are correspondingly updating our non-GAAP operating income rate to a range of 5.2% to 5.4%. We will continue to proactively navigate this rapidly changing environment, balancing the day-to-day operations with our commitment to our long term-strategy and growth initiatives. Before I turn the call over to Matt for more details on Q1 and our outlook, I want to thank our employees for everything they do for our customers in all our channels.
We are also investing in Best Buy Health. These are both areas that we know create near-term pressure, but we believe they will drive compelling financial returns over time as they scale. I also want to note that since fiscal '20, our mix of revenue from our online channel has more than doubled. We have efficiently evolved our operating model to support this shift in consumer shopping behavior, while, at the same time, navigating higher wages and increased supply chain and technology costs.
Turning now to gross profit, where our enterprise rate declined 120 basis points to 22.1%. The domestic gross profit rate declined 140 basis points, which was primarily driven by lower services margin rate, including pressure associated with Totaltech. In addition, lower product margin rates, which included increased promotional activity, and the impact of higher supply chain costs also negatively impacted our rate during the quarter. The previous items were partially offset by higher profit-sharing revenue in the company's private label and co-branded credit card arrangement.
Our regular dividend increased at least 10% compared to the prior year. Consistent with our original guidance, we expect to spend approximately $1.5 billion in share repurchases this year. Let me next share more color on our guidance for the full year. Many of the key assumptions driving our outlook from when we enter the year remain unchanged.
As we already shared, sales came in a little lower than our expectations for the first quarter, and this trend has continued into the second quarter. It is difficult to assess how much of the decline may be a longer tail associated with elevated stimulus spending last year, or overall consumer spending slowing down due to inflationary concerns and the shift of consumer spending to experiences. Based on the trends we are seeing over the past several weeks, we now feel it is more likely that we will be on the lower end of our original guidance expectations. As a result, we now expect comparable sales to decline 3% to 6%.
As Corie discussed, clearly, there is still a lot of uncertainty in macro crosscurrents. Thus, we will continue to assess the sales trends, adjusting for our spend for variable items like advertising, in-store labor, as well as discretionary areas as appropriate. We also expect favorable trends at our private label credit card arrangement to partially offset higher costs in areas like supply chain for the remainder of the year. At the same time, we remain committed to progressing the initiatives we are confident will deliver compelling financial returns in the future.
As a result of the lower sales outlook, our non-GAAP operating income rate outlook is now 5.2% to 5.4%. Based on these factors, I have just outlined, our guidance for the full year now represents the following: enterprise revenue of $48.3 billion to $49.9 billion, a comparable sales decline of 3% to 6%, enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 5.2% to 5.4%, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $8.40 to $9. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. And lastly, we still expect capital expenditures to be approximately $1.1 billion.
As we shared on our last earnings call, we no longer plan to provide quarterly guidance going forward. However, we'd like to provide context on our expectations. Several of the key themes from the first quarter are expected to be consistent in the second quarter. As a result, we anticipate that our second quarter comparable sales and the year-over-year decline in our non-GAAP operating income rate will both be very similar to our first quarter results.
Also, as a reminder, last year's second quarter includes a one-time diluted earnings per share benefit of $0.47 from a lower effective tax rate. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.",14.0,Low
BBY,2022,2,"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Best Buy's second-quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, vice president of investor relations. Please go ahead.
Some of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial condition, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's current earnings release and our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.
When we compare to two years ago, our results are very strong. Compared to the second quarter of fiscal '20, revenue was up 24% and our non-GAAP operating income is up 115%. Clearly, customer demand for technology products and services during the quarter remained very strong. Customers continue to leverage technology to meet their needs and we provide solutions that help them work, learn, entertain, cook and connect at home.
The demand was also bolstered by an overall strong consumer spending, aided by government stimulus, improving wages and high savings levels. From a merchandising perspective, we saw strong comparable sales growth in almost all categories. The biggest contributors to the sales growth in the quarter were home theater, appliances, computing, mobile phones and services. Product availability improved in the quarter.
And except for some pockets in appliances and home theater, we do not believe it materially limited our overall sales growth. Our merchant demand planning and supply chain teams once again did an amazing job managing through the difficult and constantly evolving supply chain environment. They worked strategically to bring in as much inventory as possible during the quarter with actions like acquiring additional transportation, pulling up product flow and adjusting store assortment based on availability. There will continue to be challenges, particularly as it relates to congested ports and transportation disruptions.
But our teams have set us up for as strong an inventory position as possible as we move forward into the back half of the year. As we think about the holiday period, we often have varying degrees of inventory and supply chain challenges and this year will be no different. But we feel confident in our ability to serve our customers during the holiday. The continued strong demand across retail resulted in an overall less promotional environment, which was a significant driver of our better-than-expected profitability in the quarter.
During the quarter, we provided customers multiple ways to interact with us depending on their needs, preference and comfort. Similar to last quarter, customers migrated back into stores to touch and feel products and to seek in-person expertise and service. At the same time, they continue to interact with us digitally at a significantly higher rate than prepandemic as online sales were 32% of Domestic revenues compared to 16% in Q2 of fiscal '20. Phone and chat volume also remained very high compared to prepandemic and sales via these channels continue to climb.
In addition, we leveraged our stores to drive fast and convenient fulfillment of online orders. In Q2, we continue to see about 60% of our online revenue fulfilled by stores, including in-store or curbside pickup, ship-from-store or Best Buy employees who are delivering product to customers out of more than 450 of our stores. The percent of online sales picked up by customers at our stores was 42%, similar to last year's second quarter. Clearly, the landscape, as it relates to the pandemic, has been changing rapidly and we remain keenly focused on keeping our employees and customers safe.
Last year, we introduced a very important membership pilot called Best Buy Beta. As a reminder, it includes unlimited Geek Squad technical support on all of the technology in their home no matter where or when you purchased it, including 24/7 VIP access to dedicated phone and chat teams that are only available to members. It also includes up to 24 months of product protection on most purchases from Best Buy, free delivery and standard installation, exclusive member pricing, a 60-day extended return window and free shipping of online orders, all for $199 per year. The offer is designed to give our customers the confidence that whatever their technology needs are, we will be there to help.
As part of the national rollout, we will be converting our 3.1 million existing total tech support members to the new program. I want to stress that the goal of the program is for customers to find value in the benefits and use them often. It is not designed to be a stand-alone, margin-driving service offering, particularly in the near term. In fact, as Matt will discuss later, a full rollout is a near-term investment, which we are confident will be justified with incremental sales growth and long-term customer value.
Our current 15 outlet stores focus mainly on large appliance and TV open-box product. With this new outlet pilot, we will have open-box products from all categories. It will also serve as the hub in a new services repair hub-and-spoke model we are testing as well as an auto tech mega-hub for our car tech installation. Of course, the reason we are piloting and testing so much is because we are trying some unique prototypes and we need the opportunity to learn and adjust before we roll more broadly.
For example, in our four Minneapolis test stores where we reduced the shoppable square footage to 15,000 square feet to provide more space for fulfillment, we have been making adjustments based on customer and employee feedback. We've reflowed some of the layouts, added signage to help customers understand the changes we are testing and added assortment in areas like small appliances, printing and accessories. We will continue to evolve these test stores based on learnings and feedback. As it relates to our Houston experiential 35,000 square foot store pilot, we continue to receive positive feedback from customers and employees on store design and the way we are showcasing products.
We are excited about the customer use cases this provides. For example, you could be on our dot-com experience, click on a product you like and be connected via video to a Blue Shirt in the Best Buy virtual store and never lead your living room. Or you could be standing in a store, scan a bar code and be taken through your phone directly to this virtual store where an associate could answer your question. From a fulfillment perspective, our ship-from-store hubs we piloted last year were very successful and we are continuing to iterate on the model.
We continue to see momentum with our flexible workforce initiative, which is centered on store employees becoming certified to gain expertise to perform roles outside of their primary job function. At the end of July, 80% of our associates were eligible to flex into different work zones and 50% of associates have earned four or more jobs. This allows our employees and us to schedule shifts more flexibly within the store and between channels, like virtual sales, chat, phone, remote support or employee product delivery. And very soon, we will be able to schedule associates between stores within a market.
It also gives team members the ability to earn a different hourly wage depending on the job performed and the potential for working additional shifts that otherwise may not have been available in their primary job function. We believe our flexible workforce initiatives can add to our ability to attract and retain our employees, particularly in this tight labor market. And in addition to the training and flexibility we offer, we have also invested significantly in compensation and benefits for our associates. On top of raising our starting wage to $15 last year, we provide a wide array of competitive benefits across many dimensions, including tuition reimbursement, employee product discounts, paid time off for part-time associates, backup child care, child tutor reimbursement, mental health support and many others.
Overall, we are operating with a smaller field workforce than we were prepandemic, which is very reflective how the business model has changed as our online revenue has more than doubled from two years ago. We feel like we are largely at the right number as it relates to the strategic evolution of our operating model, the demand we are seeing and the nature of our customer interactions. What is most important right now is to continue to learn and iterate. As you can imagine, having a more flexible workforce is a very important component of our operating with a smaller workforce.
There are a myriad of technology projects in development, but here are just a few examples. We will leverage the electronic sign labels in our stores to make it simpler and more seamless for customers to shop, especially in our stores with smaller shopping square footage. Specifically, we are adding messaging to the labels that mimics our dot-com experience. In other words, customers will easily be able to see if the product is in stock in that store or in another store nearby and when it could be delivered and installed.
Earlier this month, Fast Company named us to its 2021 list of the 100 Best Workplaces for Innovators. This is our first time on the list, which recognizes companies that created cultures of innovation despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. During the quarter, we continued to expand our assortment in newer categories where we can leverage our ability to commercialize new technology. For example, in the past year, across fitness and wearables, wellness and health, we have more than doubled our vendor partners and grew our SKU count by more than 150%.
This includes products like patio furniture, grills, fire pits and electric mowers, to name a few. Many of these products are available online only as part of our digital-first strategy. Altogether, they are a small part of our overall business, but growing fast as we continue to add to the assortment. In the back half of the year, we expect to add more products in the fitness, beauty, sleep, pain management, vision, hearing and electric transportation categories.
Before I conclude my prepared remarks, I want to update you on our ongoing commitment to inclusion and diversity and our community. During the second quarter, we announced our commitment to spend at least $1.2 billion with BIPOC and diverse businesses by 2025. This pledge includes plans to increase all forms of spending with black, indigenous and people of color businesses from nearly every corner of the company from how we bring goods and services to stores to where and how we advertise. The goal is to create a stronger community of diverse suppliers and to help increase BIPOC representation in the tech industry.
We are also building a diverse talent pipeline for jobs of the future. During the second quarter, we launched our first-ever opportunity for customers to donate to the Best Buy Foundation in support of teen tech centers. Between July 11 and September 11, customers can choose to donate when they make a purchase, including at Best Buy store, bestbuy.com or the Best Buy app. We also just published our 16th annual ESG report, which outlines how we are working across the company to have a positive impact on our planet, employees, customers and communities.
In terms of the environment, this past year, we exceeded our goal to reduce carbon emissions in our operations by 60% through investments in renewable energy and operational improvements. We are on track to reduce our carbon emissions 75% by 2030. And we signed the Climate Pledge, committed to be carbon neutral by 2040, a decade faster than our previous goal of 2050. We also have a robust trade-in program that brings a useful second life to products that might otherwise sit idle in someone's home or end up in a landfill.
For products that need to be recycled, we continue to operate the most comprehensive consumer electronics and appliances take-back program in the U.S., taking back more than 2 billion pounds since 2009. Available on our corporate website, our ESG report also outlines the ways we support our employees and communities. In summary, we have delivered a remarkable first half against a volatile backdrop. I am so proud of the execution of our teams as they continue to safely meet the needs of our customers in ways that I would argue no one else can.
Over the longer term, we are fundamentally in a stronger position than we expected to be in just two years ago. There has been a dramatic and structural increase in the need for technology. And we now serve a much larger install base of consumer electronics with customers who have an elevated appetite to upgrade due to constant technology innovation and needs that reflect permanent life changes like hybrid work and streaming entertainment content. This is only underscored by the recent Senate passage of the Infrastructure Bill, which will provide even more access to broadband and give us the opportunity to serve the needs of currently underserved communities.
Our unique omnichannel assets, including our ability to inspire what is possible across the breadth of CE products as well as our ability to keep it all working together the way customers want, truly differentiate us going forward in this new landscape. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Matt for details on our results and insights on our outlook for the next quarter and the full year.
Good morning, everyone. We are once again reporting very strong financial results as the demand for the products and services we provide remained high during the quarter. On Enterprise revenue of $11.8 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.98, an increase of 74% versus last year. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 6.9% increased 100 basis points.
Lastly, non-GAAP SG&A dollars grew 18% compared to last year, which was slightly favorable to our outlook of approximately 20% growth. Let me now share more details specific to our second quarter. In our Domestic segment, revenue for the quarter increased 21% to $11 billion. Our comparable sales growth was also 21% for the quarter.
As expected, the largest drivers of the expense increase versus last year were: First, higher incentive compensation for corporate and field employees of approximately $100 million, which is partially due to the suspension of our short-term incentive program last year. Second, higher store payroll costs due to changes in our operating model last year. And third, the impact of lapping our COVID-related impacts last year that resulted in higher cost this year for advertising expense, medical claims expense and our 401(k) company match. Lastly, we increased investments this year in support of our technology initiatives.
When comparing to two years ago, Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $94 million and decreased 310 basis points as a percentage of revenue. The largest drivers of the increase versus fiscal '20 were higher incentive compensation, technology investments and increased variable costs due to the higher sales volume. Partially offsetting these items was lower store payroll expense. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 8.4% versus 23% last year.
Our original outlook also reflected a scenario in which customers would resume or accelerate spend in areas that were slowed during the pandemic, such as travel and dining out. Although we are seeing some shift in consumer spending occur, the impact has been less pronounced than we previously anticipated. We now expect our comparable sales growth to be down 3% to flat to last year in the back half, which is a significant improvement from the high single-digit decline we expected entering the year. Like other companies, we continue to monitor the evolving impacts of the pandemic and supply chain pressures driven by global demand.
We continue to be confident in our ability to navigate the ever-changing environment. For the second half of the year, we expect non-GAAP gross profit rate to be down approximately 30 basis points to last year, which compares to 60 basis points of expansion in the first half of the year. The primary drivers of the sequential decrease include the impact of rolling out total tech, increased promotional activity and less leverage on our supply chain costs than we experienced in the first half of this year. The gross profit rate pressure of our new membership offering primarily relates to the incremental customer benefits and the associated costs compared to our previous total tech support offer.
For SG&A, we expect growth of approximately 9%, which compares to the prior outlook of 6% to 7% growth. The increased expense is primarily due to higher store payroll costs and other variable items associated with the higher sales outlook. In addition, we expect the incentive compensation for the full year to increase by approximately $275 million or at the high end of our previously provided range. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 20%.",14.0,Low
BBY,2022,3,"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Best Buy's Q3 FY 2022 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Mollie O'Brien, vice president of investor relations.
Some of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial condition, business initiatives, growth plans, investments, and expected performance of the company, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's current earnings release and our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Q for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.
We continue to capitalize on strong customer demand as more people sustainably work, entertain, cook, and connect at home. And Domestic comparable sales growth was up 2% on top of 23% last year. From a merchandising perspective, the biggest contributors to our comparable sales growth in the quarter were appliances, home theater, and mobile phones. Product availability continued to improve throughout quarter.
We have pockets of constraints in areas like appliances, gaming, and mobile phones. Similar to last quarter, however, we do not believe this materially limited our overall sales growth. While we have faced and continue to face supply chain challenges, including delays and higher costs, we are proactively navigating a situation that we have been dealing with for several quarters, as our industry has been facing disruptions and supply constraints since early in the pandemic. Our merchant demand planning and supply chain teams made strategic sourcing and inventory decisions early in the year to set us up well heading into holiday.
And we are resourcefully adapting to the constantly evolving environment with actions like pulling up product flow, adjusting store assortment based on availability, and acquiring additional alternative transportation. We have deep, long-standing relationships with our transportation and logistics vendors, and they have been incredibly supportive as we navigate. In addition, through our close partnerships with our product vendors, we have a great deal of visibility into and can influence the status of product in the supply chain process. We have varying degrees of inventory and supply chain challenges every holiday season, and this year will be no different.
But we entered Q4 with 15% more inventory year over year and feel confident in our ability to serve our customers throughout the holiday. As expected, we did experience a more promotional environment for many of our products when compared to last year. When compared to two years ago, we still saw a less promotional environment during Q3. From a sales channel perspective, results were similar to last quarter.
Customers are returning to stores, and they are also choosing to interact with us digitally and via phone and chat at much higher rates than pre-pandemic. Online sales were 31% of domestic revenue compared to 16% in Q3 of fiscal '20, growing by more than $2 billion during that time. Our app saw a 19% increase in unique visitors versus last year, and phone and chat sales continued to climb versus last year and two years ago. We continue to be an industry leader in fast and convenient product fulfillment for our customers.
During the third quarter, we reached our fastest small product delivery times ever. Compared to last year, same-day delivery was up 400%, and we nearly doubled the percent of products delivered within one day. Based on a third-party analysis of competitor websites, we are the leader in one-day-or-less published shipping time across a sample of higher-volume ZIP codes and higher-demand items. In addition to partnering with a diversified set of delivery partners, we also thoughtfully used our employee delivery capability, as we now have more than 400 stores doing employee deliveries, with almost 60% of our customers living within 10 miles of an employee delivery location.
We also have an industry-leading in-store pickup experience. We have, by far, the broadest assortment of CE products available for pickup, and the process is incredibly fast. In Q3, more than 90% of online orders that were available for product pickup were ready in less than 30 minutes of the order being placed. Customers clearly find value in coming to our stores to pick up their products as the percent of online sales picked up at our stores remained high at 42%, even with our fast home delivery options, with one-third of our store-pickup customers choosing our convenient curbside option.
And our customer NPS for order pickup in Q3 was up versus last year and two years ago. In fact, in the last year, 31% of all our purchasing customers bought online and picked up in store at least once. These strong Q3 results and our market-leading omnichannel capabilities are due to our amazing associates across the company and the investment decisions we have made in the last several years in supply chain, store operations, our people, and technology. Clearly, our business has changed dramatically in the last two years, with digital sales more than double pre-pandemic levels and phone, chat, and in-home sales growing.
Customers are starting their research and shopping online and then branching out from there to all forms of digital and physical shopping depending on their specific needs. Stores are crucial to our customer experience, and they need to be even more efficient and must keep pace with greater customer expectations. For example, we know customers sometimes seek out in-person help to answer questions. And other times, they would rather use digital tools to learn about products or pick up their orders in our stores.
That led us to launch Best Buy Totaltech last month. Totaltech is a bold new membership program, leveraging our strengths across merchandising, fulfillment, installation, tech support, and product repair, unique capabilities that customer's value and no one else can match. Our membership program offers product discounts and periodic access to hard-to-get inventory, free delivery and installation, free technical support, free product protection, and many other benefits. Let me provide a tangible example of how the offer can come to life.
But right now, we are very focused on piloting and testing to build a framework that will move us from a retailer that's focused foremost on its stores to a true omnichannel one that provides equal focus on all the ways customers shop with us. I will provide a few updates on our progress. We launched phase 1 of our virtual store pilot last month. For this, we built out a physical store in one of our distribution centers with merchandising and products that is staffed with dedicated associates, including vendor-provided expert labor.
It has no physical customers. Instead, customers interact with our experts via chat, audio, video, and screen sharing depending on their preference and are able to see live demos, displays, and physical products. It is early, and we have not rolled out all the product categories yet. But initial results are showing much higher conversion rates, as well as higher average order value than we see with historical chat interactions.
In Charlotte, we have made significant progress rolling out the market pilot designed to leverage all our assets in a portfolio strategy across stores, fulfillment, services, in outlet, lockers, our digital app, and both in-store and in-home consultation labor. We launched our new outlet featuring all product categories in addition to a new services hub model and remodeled eight stores. And in Houston, we are continuing to see strong results from our experiential store pilot and plan to roll out aspects of this more broadly in stores across the country as we enter next year. These are not the only pilots happening, and thus, they aren't the only pilots that will influence where we go as a company.
From Northern California to Houston to The Bronx, we are assessing new formats and learning our way to the right physical model. At the same time, we are piloting and evolving our labor models in other markets to meet our customer's changing shopping behaviors. That means leveraging technology in stores that don't have as much labor and developing a much more flexible workforce. This is a workforce that can not only provide expert help across product categories, both in-store and virtually, but also flex into other activities like curbside fulfillment, and it empowers employees to flexibly pick up shifts at other stores or at our distribution centers.
Turning to the product support we provide, as many of you likely know, when something goes wrong with your products or delivery or installation, it is a highly unplanned and often emotional event. Not surprisingly, our customer research tells us that customers value quick response times and demand transparency, fast repair times, and quality repairs from a trusted provider. Our Geek Squad has an industry-leading set of capabilities that garner market-leading NPS and also drive additional revenue for Best Buy in the moment and over time. Around 20% of our phone and computer repair customers purchase additional products the day they receive the repair.
Our vendors partner with us to provide expert training and tools for our consultants and designers. And importantly, our vendors are increasingly sending sales leads from their own websites to our consultants and designers. We are also leveraging our unique Geek Squad capabilities to strengthen and expand our partnerships with our vendors. We are already the nation's largest physical destination for Apple-authorized repair services, including same-day iPhone repairs, attracting new customers as one-third of these Apple repair customers are new or reengaged customers for Best Buy.
Customers purchasing select items on samsung.com now have the option to pick up their products at their local Best Buy store. And shoppers purchasing Insignia, Toshiba, and Pioneer Fire TVs on amazon.com can pick up their TVs at their local Best Buy stores. For many of our vendors, we use our considerable supply chain expertise to transport their product often from the country of origin to our distribution centers. In addition to helping our vendors, it allows us to increase our level of visibility into incoming inventory and to garner greater scale.
This includes products like patio furniture, grills, fire pits, and electric mowers, just to name a few. In fact, earlier this month, we acquired Yardbird, a leading direct-to-consumer company that specializes in premium sustainable outdoor furniture, including dining sets, lounge seating, fire tables, and accessories. We are excited about the opportunity to use our expertise in merchandising and supply chain to scale this business, both online and in physical locations across the nation. We also made an exciting acquisition recently in the health space.
The second area is active aging, which includes device-based emergency response and other services for Generation A, who wish to live independently in their homes. This opportunity shows up prominently in our physical stores. The third focus area is virtual care. Best Buy's role in virtual care is to enable people in their homes to connect seamlessly with their healthcare providers.
We need technology tools and capabilities to help us as we transform and evolve the way we operate and serve our customers. That is why we continue to devote significant resources to technology investments. For example, we are leveraging our investments in electronic sign labels to very nimbly highlight Best Buy Totaltech member pricing for customers shopping in our stores. We also just launched the ability for our electronic sign labels to provide important messaging regarding product availability, so that customers will easily be able to see if the product is in stock in that store or at another store nearby, or when it could be delivered and installed.
Technology was instrumental in recently launching the first of many new communication enhancements to improve our award-winning appliance customer experience. Metro delivery customers that utilize the appointment tracker page on the day of their delivery can now see how many stops away their driver is at any given time. It may seem like a small enhancement but already we can see significant customer engagement with the page, another step toward our goal to make customers feel confident and in control throughout the research, purchase, fulfillment, and use of their large product. Technology was also crucial in our recent launching of next-day delivery of appliances and large TVs, which we are piloting first for in-store and online customers in our Minneapolis and Baltimore markets.
And of course, we are also continuing to make significant investments in fundamental technology capabilities, like data and analytics, and broader cloud migration in order to drive scale, efficiency, and effectiveness. I would like to take a moment to extend my gratitude to our people. Over the past 21 months, they have flexibly dealt with rapidly changing store operations as we responded to impacts of the pandemic. They created safe environments for customers and worked tirelessly to provide excellent service, even in situations where customers resisted following safety guidelines and in some cases were disrespectful.
And I'm thrilled to say that our in-store NPS in Q3 increased versus last year and versus two years ago before the pandemic despite all of these disruptions. Now, I would like to briefly touch on our ESG efforts and how we are working across the company to have a positive impact on our planet. Earlier this month, we announced that we are a founding member of the Race to Zero initiative that aims to accelerate climate action within the retail industry. Best Buy's participation builds on our existing efforts to reduce our carbon footprint.
We are proud of our progress in reducing emissions 61% since 2009, and we have pledged to be carbon neutral by 2040. We have also taken on a more specific focus on the circular economy within our operations and with our customers. In Q3, we collected and responsibly recycled more than 48 million pounds of consumer electronics, keeping products and commodities out of landfills. To help our customers live more sustainably, last quarter, we sold more than 5 million ENERGY STAR-certified products, helping our customers reduce their carbon footprint and save on utility bills.
We also kept more than 600,000 devices in use longer and out of landfills by leveraging our customer trade-in program, Geek Squad repair services, and Best Buy outlets. These are initiatives our customers and vendors value and capabilities no one else has at our scale and breadth. In summary, we have delivered remarkable year-to-date results, and I am so proud of the execution of all our teams. We are looking forward to a strong holiday season and believe we are extremely well-positioned with both the tech customer's wants and fast and convenient ways to get it.
We launched some of our Black Friday deals in mid-October that included a price guarantee for all customers, and this past Friday started Black Friday early by making almost all of our Black Friday deals available. Throughout the holiday season, we are promising free next-day delivery on thousands of items. And of course, store pickup, whether in-store or curbside, will be a great and convenient option for our customers to get their products. Building on that, as we think about next year and beyond, we are mindful of just how much the consumer has changed and how enduring that change will be.
Given our omnichannel capabilities, the ones we have today and the ones we are building for the future, we are fully confident that we will capitalize on a much larger, more broadly defined consumer electronics category, and be able to better serve a customer who will be using and upgrading much of that CE more frequently. We plan to hold an investor event next March to share more detail on our initiatives, provide our thoughts on our financial model going forward, and introduce longer-term financial targets. I will now turn the call over to Matt for more color on our financial results.
The gross profit rate pressure from our new membership offering primarily relates to the incremental customer benefits and associated costs compared to our previous Total Tech Support offer. As Corie mentioned, like many others, we saw increased transportation costs within our supply chain. However, this pressure was offset by reduced parcel expense since our mix of online sales was lower than last year. The international non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 240 basis points to 25%.
When comparing to two years ago, domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $155 million and decreased 230 basis points as a percentage of revenue. The largest drivers of the increase versus fiscal '20 were higher incentive compensation, increased technology and advertising investments, and additional variable costs due to the higher sales volume. Partially offsetting these items was lower store payroll expense. Moving to the balance sheet.
We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in cash. At the end of Q3, our inventory balance was 15% higher than last year's comparable period and was 13% higher than our Q3 ending inventory balance from two years ago. The increased inventory represents our plans to support the current demand for technology, as well as last year's unusually low inventory balance. Earlier this month, we completed our acquisitions of Current Health and Yardbird, which will be reflected on our cash flow statement in Q4.
The combined purchase price of the two transactions was approximately $485 million, and they were funded with cash. The Current Health acquisition was a larger cash outlay at approximately $400 million and is expected to have a slightly negative impact on our Q4 non-GAAP operating income. We are not expecting either acquisition to have a material impact on our revenue performance this year. During the quarter, we returned a total of $577 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $405 million and dividends of $172 million.
With a year-to-date share buyback spend of $1.7 billion, we still expect to spend more than $2.5 billion in share repurchases this year. Let me next share more color on our guidance for the fourth quarter, which remains very similar to the implied guidance we provided last quarter. We expect comparable sales growth to be in the range of down 2% to up 1% to last year, which is on top of our 12.6% comparable sales growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Like other companies, we continue to monitor the evolving impacts of the pandemic and supply chain pressures driven by global demand.
We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 20%, and we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.",14.0,Low
BBY,2023,2,"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Best Buy second fiscal quarter 2023 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, vice president of investor relations.
Some of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial condition, business initiatives, growth plans, investments, and expected performance of the company, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's current earnings release and our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am incredibly proud of our teams as they continue to rise to the challenges of the past few years. With so much going on that is beyond their control, I remain impressed with their ability to manage the rapidly shifting business environment and priorities. As we said in March, we expected our financial results would be softer this year as we lapped record sales volumes.
However, the macro environment has been more challenged and uneven than expected due to several factors. And that has put more pressure on our industry, changing the trajectory of our business versus our original plan. We are focused on balancing our near-term response to difficult conditions and managing well what is in our control while also delivering on our strategic initiatives and what will be important for our long-term growth. Our strategy and our confidence in it remains unchanged.
We have exciting opportunities ahead of us in a world that is more reliant on technology than ever. We are a financially strong company with a resilient world-class team that will successfully navigate the current environment. Now, on to the second quarter results we reported this morning. Our comparable sales were down 12.1% as we lapped strong Q2 comparable sales last year of almost 20%.
We assumed the CE industry would be lower following two years of elevated growth, driven by unusually strong demand for technology, products, and services; and fueled partly by stimulus dollars. In addition, we expected to see some impact to our business as customers broadly shifted their wallet spend back into experience areas, such as travel and entertainment. We did not expect and compounding these impacts is a changing macro environment where consumers are dealing with sustained and record-high levels of inflation in some of the most fundamental parts of their daily lives, like food. While these factors have led to an uneven sales environment, they have not deterred us from continuing to make progress on our initiatives.
During the quarter, we drove broad customer NPS improvements, even compared to pre-pandemic levels, particularly in installation and repair. We signed up new Best Buy Totaltech members and increased our delivery speed, delivering almost 1/3 of customer online orders in one day. We also completed store remodels, opened new outlet stores, and began implementing newly signed deals with healthcare companies. From a top-line perspective, we saw year-over-year sales declines across most product categories with the largest impacts to comparable sales coming from computing and home theater.
This is not across all categories, but, for example, in the television category, customers are moving more into our lower price point exclusive brands products. We're also seeing more interest in sales events, such as prime day, tax-free events, and other events geared at exceptional value. I applaud our team's proactive management of our inventory during the quarter, as we saw the sales trajectory changing. Our inventory at the end of Q2 was down 6% from the second quarter of last year and up approximately 16% from pre-pandemic fiscal '20.
Overall, our inventory is healthy and reflects an evolving mix of product in our network, including more high ASP appliances and larger screen televisions, which also have longer lead times and a slower inventory turn. While we took more inventory markdowns than last year, the level reflected a normalization to pre-pandemic activity. Within our inventory numbers, there are categories where we have ample inventory supply and still pockets where we are constrained. In our industry, it's not as simple as we have inventory or we don't.
It can be incredibly variable by product and even brands within a particular product. For example, we are also still experiencing inventory constraints in key models and brands across computing and gaming. As we move into the back half of the year, we are planning inventory thoughtfully, yet investing strategically for holiday. While it is important to manage inventory against current demand, we also want to ensure we are well-positioned to react to the ever-changing consumer needs.
In addition, we estimate that roughly half of the increased supply chain costs this quarter versus the comparable period in fiscal '20 is being driven by cost increases or inflationary pressures. Conditions across the global supply chain continue to evolve on a year-over-year basis, we saw higher costs in Q2 and expect that to continue through the remainder of the year. However, we are starting to see some signs that the market is stabilizing and moderating. During the pandemic, the capacity and rate pressures started in international and worked their way to domestic logistics.
I would like to provide an update on Totaltech, our unique membership program designed to provide customers with complete confidence in their technology, with benefits that include member pricing discounts, product protection, free delivery and standard installation, and 24/7 tech support. Considering the macro environment and decline in our product sales, we are encouraged with the pace at which we are acquiring new members. In Q2, nearly half of the new members joining the program were either new or lapsed customers, reinforcing how the value of this program resonates beyond our existing loyal customers. Our associates continue to embrace the program as the fulsome nature of the offering not only simplifies the sales interaction, it also is a program our team members can confidently stand behind as they believe in the value it provides to every single customer.
Of course, our stores remain incredibly important for customers to see and touch products and get advice. In addition, they're crucial to our fulfillment strategy. In the second quarter, customers representing 42% of our online sales chose to pick up their products at our stores, and an additional 18% of online sales were shipped out of our store to customer homes. These in-store pickup and ship from store numbers have remained incredibly consistent for the last several years, even as shipping speed and options have dramatically increased.
It is imperative that we evaluate how we operate in service of these evolving customer needs and make the necessary adjustments to ensure we come out of this not just a vital company but a vibrant one. We tested new field operating models in four markets over the past year to help us better understand how to deploy leadership resources in a more digital world. As a result of these tests, earlier this month, we made structural changes to our operating model that resulted in some store rolls being eliminated. We hope to retain as many of these talented associates as possible.
Just opened last month, the store includes a 7-foot-tall digital display that customers will see as they enter the store that explains what's new and how customers can shop. The store includes curated assortments across our product categories, except for major appliances and other large products. The majority of products will primarily be on display to touch and try. To purchase, customers can scan the QR code on any product price tag using their phone.
This immediately sends a notification to a Best Buy employee to pick up the product from the store's back room and bring it to the register for checkout. Of course, customers who want to will be able to consult with sales associates, in-home consultants, and geek squad agents, who always have access to our complete assortment online using our increasingly rapid shipping. From an online sales fulfillment perspective, the store offers both in-store pickup and convenient lockers. The Charlotte market pilot also includes a traditional core store that we converted to an outlet store.
The outlet has an expanded assortment of product categories, a dedicated team of employees and agents that rapidly quality check and repair all product for resale, a new services repair hub-and-spoke model, and an auto tech mega hub for car tech installation. This outlet is performing extremely well and is frankly on track to deliver revenue on par to the pre-converted conventional store, with a considerably lower operating cost and greater productivity. Those results give us confidence in our outlet strategy. During the quarter, we opened two new outlet stores in Virginia and Phoenix, and just opened a location in Chicago earlier this month, bringing us to 19 locations.
We see twice the recovery rates of our costs when we sell open-box, clearance, and end-of-life inventory at our outlets versus alternative channels. With assortment expanded to include major appliances, large TVs, computing, gaming, and mobile phones, we believe now is an opportune time to appeal to our existing Best Buy customers, as well as an increasingly deal-seeking consumer overall. Our outlet store assortment is also available for purchase online, with many products eligible for national shift to home fulfillment, as well as local store pickup. This capability unlocks a very productive way to refurbish inventory, giving it a new life while also serving a deal-seeking customer.
I am very proud of how much work the team has done to test and iterate multiple store and operating model concepts over the past few years. In response to the dramatic pivot in customer behavior, we introduced a great deal of change into the field. Not all went perfectly, and we have learned and accelerated some initiatives while stopping others. On top of that, of course, the macro backdrop has shifted, and the trajectory of the business has changed significantly in an incredibly short time.
We continue to invest in our people and our stores with an eye toward the best possible customer experience, leveraging our unique differentiators through all the changes. Overarching store NPS is substantially higher than pre-pandemic, including more stores than we have ever seen at what we consider to be best-in-class levels. This is entirely due to our amazing store associates' hard work and dedication to always being there for our customers. We have consistently invested in our employees over the past three years, including raising hourly wages more than 20% versus pre-pandemic and adding additional benefits, such as paid caregiver leave, financial hardship assistance, and paid time off for part-time employees.
During the second quarter, we continued to see strong growth in new signups for our active aging business that offers health and safety solutions to enable adults to live and thrive at home. Revenue for this business was slightly up in the quarter compared to last year. We are encouraged by the momentum we have built in the virtual care business in the first half of the year. We are very focused on successfully implementing the large U.S.
And last year, we became a founding member of the Breakthrough 2030 Retail Campaign, which aims to accelerate climate action within our industry. We continue to operate the most comprehensive consumer electronics and appliances take-back program in the U.S., collecting more than £2.5 billion since 2009. We also made significant progress toward our fiscal '25 hiring commitments to help ensure we build an inclusive, diverse, and thriving workforce. In fiscal '22, we filled 37% of new salaried corporate positions with Black, Indigenous, and people of color employees, ahead of our goal to fill 1 in 3 positions.
And we filled 26% of new salaried field positions with women employees, marking progress on our goal to fill 1 of 3 positions. We're proud that 60% of our most senior leaders, including our board of directors and executive team, is made up of women and people of color. We encourage you to review our full ESG report available on our corporate website. In summary, the first half of the year has been difficult from a sales perspective, and our employees have executed well in the evolving environment, in many cases making hard decisions to run the business effectively and prioritize our customers.
I just want to take a moment to address the fiscal '25 financial goals we introduced in March. We remain confident in the strategic premise covered in March. However, the current macro backdrop has changed in ways that we and many others were not expecting. As such, we are removing these targets, and we'll share more context on our midterm financial expectations once we begin to experience a more stable operating environment.
As our vendor partners continue to innovate and the world becomes increasingly more digital in all aspects, we will be there to uniquely help customers in our stores online, virtually, and directly in their homes. This company has navigated monumental change, riding incredible highs and managing difficult lows since our founding 56 years ago. As we have done throughout our history, we will use this moment to lead and double down on our purpose, making it clear that we continue to uniquely support customers in ways literally no one else can. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Matt for additional details on our second quarter results and outlook for the remainder of the year.
Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 4.1% compared to 6.9% last year. As expected and similar to last quarter, our investment in Totaltech membership added approximately 100 basis points of operating income rate pressure this quarter compared to last year. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $129 million lower than last year, but were 120 basis points unfavorable as a percentage of revenue. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.54 decreased $1.44 or 48%.
A lower share count resulted in a $0.16 per share benefit on a year-over-year basis. However, it was offset by a higher non-GAAP tax rate. In our domestic segment, revenue decreased 13.1% to $9.6 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 12.7%. From a monthly phasing standpoint, fiscal June's comparable sales decline of 16% was the largest decline, whereas fiscal July was our best performing month during the quarter compared to both last year and to the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 comparable period.
As Corie noted, from a category standpoint, the largest contributors to the comparable sales decline in the quarter were computing and home theater. In our international segment, revenue decreased 9.3% to $760 million. This decrease was driven by a comparable sales decline of 4.2% in Canada and the negative impact of 420 basis points from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. This marks the first quarter where Mexico was fully removed from the prior year comparison.
Turning now to gross profit. Our enterprise rate declined 160 basis points to 22.1%. The domestic gross profit rate declined 170 basis points, which was primarily driven by the lower services margin rates, including pressure from Totaltech. In addition, lower product margin rates and the impact of higher supply chain costs also negatively impacted our rate during the quarter.
On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate was 16.7% versus 8.4% last year. For the full year, we now expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 23% versus our previous guidance of approximately 24%. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $840 million in cash.
As Corie mentioned, at the end of Q2, our inventory balance was approximately 6% lower than last year's comparable period. And we continue to feel good about our overall inventory position as well as the health of our inventory. Year to date, we have returned a total of $862 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $465 million and dividends of $397 million. We paused share repurchases during the second quarter, spending only $10 million.
Looking forward, we will continue to assess the appropriate timing for resuming share repurchases. We are committed to being a premium dividend payer. Based on our current planning assumptions for fiscal '23, our quarterly dividend of $0.88 per share will fall outside of our stated payout ratio target of 35% to 45% of our non-GAAP net income. We viewed this target as a long term in nature and do not plan to reduce the dividend should it fall outside of the range in any one year.
This is due to a belief that the current macro environment trends could be even more challenging and have a larger impact for the remainder of the year. This aligns with the trends we are seeing so far this quarter as August revenue declined approximately 10% versus last year. When comparing to fiscal '20, August revenue increased in the low single-digit range, which is a sequential decline from the second quarter trends. Our outlook for a non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 4% for the year is anchored to our negative 11% comparable sales assumption.
Consistent with prior practice, restructuring costs are excluded from our non-GAAP results. Lastly, let me share a couple of comments specific to the third quarter. We anticipate that our third quarter comparable sales declined slightly more than the negative 12% we reported for the second quarter. We anticipate the year-over-year decline in our non-GAAP operating income rate will be similar to or slightly higher than our second quarter results.",14.0,Low
BBY,2023,3,"Some of the statements we'll make today are considered forward looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial condition, business initiatives, growth plans, investments, and expected performance of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.
We are excited about the promotions and deals we have planned for all our customers, including special promotions available to Totaltech and My Best Buy members. We have curated gift lists with inspiration for all, from family members to foodies and content creators to gamers. For added ease of shopping and peace of mind, we have extended both our store hours and our product return policy for the holiday season. We're also offering free next-day delivery on thousands of items in addition to our convenient store and curbside pickup option.
For the first nine months of the year, our online sales as a percentage of domestic revenue were 31%, nearly twice as high as pre-pandemic. We expect that penetration rate to begin to increase again over time as it did pre-pandemic. Additionally, customer demand for other virtual interactions has remained elevated, and we have seen strong and sustained sales growth from our investments in chat, phone, and video sales experiences this year. Of course, that also means that almost 70% of customers are shopping in our stores, and customers representing 42% of our online sales pick up their products at our stores.
We are also leveraging technology in our stores more than ever to continue to elevate our customer and employee experiences in more cost-effective ways. For example, we have introduced a new app for our associates called Solution Sidekick that provides a guided selling experience consistent across departments, channels, and locations. With the app, associates interacting with the customer can see the customer's profile in the moment, including historical purchases and active memberships. As the associate starts an order with product recommendations, the app automatically calculates total tax savings for existing and prospective members and recommends additional product solution.
Importantly, if a customer isn't ready to buy in the moment, associates can send the product recommendations and a recap of the conversation to the customer via email, text or QR code so they can purchase later at their convenience. It is early, but we are very encouraged by the ramping employee adoption of the app and the higher revenue per transaction we are seeing when associates leverage Solution Sidekick. We are also leveraging our investment in electronic sign labels to provide a better and more efficient experience for customers who want to buy a product that is locked up or not readily available on the shelf. We've added new functionality that allows the customer to scan the QR code with their phone's camera and push a button, notifying they are ready to purchase.
This sends the store associate an instant and prioritized notification to pick the product and have it ready at pickup. We also took a much more digital approach when building out the experience for our 5,000-square-foot store pilot we opened in Charlotte over the summer, highly leveraging these digital tools. Similar to the U.S., we are evolving our model in Canada as well and continue to see better-than-expected financial results there. We have been piloting initiatives there, including technology subscription, online marketplace, a market-focused test and small-store formats.
Totaltech is a comprehensive membership with wide appeal across demographics. For example, younger generations and those with children utilize more of our newer warranty and member pricing benefits, and older generations utilize more of our enhanced services and support benefit. Our associates continue to love the program since it clearly provides value to every single customer and simplifies the sales interaction. While we are encouraged by the results in the first full year, we will continue to iterate based on the macro environment and what is most relevant to our customers.
As we said last quarter, we have been encouraged with the pace at which we have been acquiring new customers, considering the uniqueness of the offer, the macro environment, and the decline in our product sales. Nevertheless, these factors have resulted in a lower member count than our original expectations. Last quarter, we enhanced our in-store point-of-sale tools to better assist our team in showcasing the value of Totaltech to potential new members. And the early results continue to be positive.
In the current economic environment, many consumers are facing increasing financial constraints. We believe we are well positioned to meet customers' needs in this environment. In addition to creating key promotional moments, offering competitive prices, repairing and supporting existing products, and scaling our Best Buy outlets, we offer multiple financing options to improve affordability. These include our co-branded Citibank credit card lease-to-own program, buy-now-pay-later options, and most recently, our exclusive Upgrade+ program for Apple MacBooks.
Before closing and turning the call over to Matt, I would like to provide a few updates on our commitment to our employees and the communities we serve. The Best Buy Foundation's Teen Tech Centers are providing access, inspiration, and opportunity for young people in the communities that need it most. We continue to expand the program with 52 Teen Tech Centers open across the country, including opening our ninth tech center in the Twin Cities, our hometown. We also remain committed to creating an environment where all employees feel engaged and have access to specialized benefits and resources.
We're proud to have women leaders at the highest levels of our company and believe it reflects our commitment to support our employees and their loved ones. This year, we are honored to rank No. 15 on Forbes 2022 list of the world's top female-friendly company, which recognizes companies that support women professionally and personally. Similarly, we were honored to be named as one of Forbes 2022 America's Best Employers for Veterans, our first time on that list.
Indicators remain unusually varied. The job market remains strong, consumer spending continues, and inflation appears to be slowing a bit. But savings are starting to erode, consumer confidence is low, the housing market is cooling, and inflation remains a particular concern on the basics like food, fuel, and lodging, all of which have a profound and sustained impact. As you would expect, we are planning for multiple scenarios given the very unsettled and uneven consumer response to these varied indicators.
We are adjusting our cost structure as we respond to current and potential future conditions. We are also making strategic decisions and trade-offs to continue to advance our initiatives. We are doubling down on our ability to lead the future of omnichannel retail and capitalize on opportunities as the industry moves through this downturn and eventually returns to growth again. We are as confident and excited about our future as ever.
Technology demand over the past few years has resulted in a larger install base, and customers will want and need to replace and upgrade their tech devices, particularly as we near the three-year mark since the start of the pandemic. At the same time, our technology vendor partners will continue to innovate and drive excitement and demand. We are the leading technology solutions provider for the home, a home increasingly dependent on all this technology working together and evolving over time. We are uniquely positioned to inspire and help customers with all aspects of their technology, from deciding what to purchase to installing it and getting the most out of it, all the way to helping when it's not working.
We leverage our specialized Geek Squad agents, our expert sales associates and consultants, experienced merchants, and sophisticated supply chain to deliver experiences no one else can in customers' homes virtually, digitally, and in our stores. I will now turn the call over to Matt for more details on our third-quarter financials and fourth-quarter outlook.
Third, this year's financial performance has benefited from lower incentive compensation when compared to fiscal '20. As we reset performance targets at the start of next year, this is not a structural benefit. This highlights how we have been adjusting our cost structure to navigate the dramatic changes in our business while balancing the need to invest in our initiatives. Let me now transition to third-quarter results.
Enterprise revenue of $10.6 billion declined 10.4% on a comparable basis and our non-GAAP operating income rate of 3.9% compared to 5.8% last year. A gross profit rate decline of approximately 50 basis points was the primary driver of the lower operating income rate. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $188 million lower than last year but were 40 basis points unfavorable as a percentage of revenue. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.38 compared to $2.08 last year.
Next, I will walk through the details of our third-quarter results compared to last year before providing insights into how we were thinking about the fourth quarter. In our domestic segment, revenue decreased 10.8% to $9.8 billion, driven by comparable sales decline of 10.5%. From a monthly phasing standpoint, October's year-over-year comparable sales decline of 15% was the largest decline, while September was our best-performing month. Conversely, when comparing to the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 comparable period, October had the most growth.
While holiday shopping was more prevalent this October compared to pre-pandemic fiscal '20, it was lower than last year when there was more of an urgency for consumers to get products early due to supply chain fears. In our international segment, revenue decreased 14.9% to $787 million. This decrease was driven by comparable sales decline of 9.3% in Canada and the negative impact of 480 basis points from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Turning now to gross profit, our enterprise rate declined 150 basis points to 22%.
Our domestic gross profit also declined 150 basis points, with the primary drivers consistent with expectations as well as the past two quarters. These drivers include, one, lower product margins, which were primarily due to increased promotions; two, lower services margins rates, including pressure from Totaltech; and three, the impact of higher supply chain costs. These items were partially offset by higher profit-sharing revenue from the company's credit card arrangement. As a reminder, the gross profit rate pressure from Totaltech primarily relates to the incremental customer benefits and associated costs compared to our previous Totaltech support offer.
As Corie shared, we fully lapped last year's national rollout in October. As a result, the approximately 60 basis points headwind to last year from lower services margin rates was a sequential improvement from the past two quarters. Moving next to SG&A. As I stated earlier, our enterprise non-GAAP SG&A decreased $188 million while increasing 40 basis points as a percentage of sales.
Within the domestic segment, the primary drivers were lower incentive compensation and reduced store payroll costs. Incentive compensation was favorable to last year by approximately $100 million this quarter and $365 million year to date. Our store payroll expense, which excludes the impact from incentive compensation, was favorable to last year, both in dollars and as a percentage of sales. International SG&A was $150 million, decreased $21 million while increasing 60 basis points as a percentage of sales.
The decrease was primarily driven by a lower incentive compensation expense and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate was 23.8% versus 25% last year. For the full year, we now expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 21% versus our previous guidance of approximately 23%. The lower outlook for the full year is primarily due to discrete tax matters in the fourth quarter.
Year to date, we have returned over $1 billion to shareholders through dividends of $595 million and share repurchases of $465 million. We paused share repurchases during the second quarter and recently resumed repurchasing shares in early November. We now expect to spend a total of approximately $1 billion in share repurchases this fiscal year. We are committed to being a premium dividend payer.
The improved outlook for the full year is entirely driven by our third-quarter results as our expectations remain unchanged for the fourth quarter. We continue to believe that the current macro environment trends will remain challenging for the remainder of the year. Although the year-over-year sales decline in Q4 is expected to be similar to sales decline we just reported for Q3, our outlook implies a larger deceleration versus the pre-pandemic fiscal '20. As expected, the year-over-year sales decline for the first few weeks of November is similar to the decline we saw in October.
For the fourth quarter specifically, while still expect a majority of the year-over-year operating income rate decline to be driven by lower gross profit rate, there's less pressure than prior quarters as we lap Totaltech and some of the supply chain inflationary impacts. I will now turn the call over to the operators for questions.",14.0,Low
BIIB,2022,1,"Good morning. My name is Cecilia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen first quarter 2022 earnings call and business update. [Operator instructions].
We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially.
I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I am joined by our chief executive officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Priya Singhal, interim head of research and development; and our CFO, Mike McDonnell. As a reminder, during the Q&A portion of the call, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question.
Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We continue to execute on our core business objectives in the first quarter. Mike and Priya will review our quarterly performance and recent progress in R&D, while I focus on our strategy and near-term operational priorities.
This includes the continued launch of SPINRAZA and may also include pursuing local business development opportunities. Both -- we plan to drive renewed growth in our biosimilars business, although our portfolio of NTMS products slightly past the peak of its life cycle. We currently have four more programs in development, and in the near term, we are preparing to launch BYOOVIZ, referencing LUCENTIS in the U.S. in the coming half.
Our fifth near-term priority is capital allocation. Biogen is fortunate to have a strong balance sheet with $4.8 billion in cash as of the end of the quarter and modest net debt, as well as strong cash flow generation. Going forward, we plan to continue to focus the deployment of cash toward initiatives designed to create incremental revenue growth opportunities while continuing to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases. In summary, the challenges faced by the company over the last -- the past 12 months have been significant.
I will be leaving at a time of promise for Biogen with noteworthy potential for value creation, and I look forward working with my successor through a smooth transition. I will now turn the call over to Priya for an update on our recent progress in R&D.
Our MS business inclusive of Ocrevus royalties delivered $1.6 billion in revenue. Tecfidera continues to be impacted by generic entry in the U.S. and was negatively impacted by pricing pressure outside of the U.S. Vumerity first quarter global revenue was $128 million.
Overall, we expect full year biosimilars revenue to decrease versus the prior year due to pricing pressure in Europe. Total anti-CD20 revenue grew 3% with increased Ocrevus royalties being partially offset by a continued decline in RITUXAN revenues due to biosimilar competition. First quarter gross margin was negatively impacted by a $275 million charge for Aduhelm inventory write-offs, as well as approximately $45 million of idle capacity charges. Note that Eisai's share of these charges is reflected in the collaboration profit sharing line.
First quarter collaboration profit sharing reduced our net operating expense by $117 million, which includes reimbursement of approximately $182 million from Eisai, partially offset by $64 million of net profit sharing expense related to our collaboration with Samsung Bioepis. In the first quarter, we generated approximately $162 million in cash flow from operations, which was negatively impacted by the timing of certain payments. Capital expenditures were $58 million and free cash flow was approximately $104 million. We ended the quarter with $7.3 billion in debt, $4.8 billion in cash and marketable securities, and $2.5 billion in net debt.
We are reaffirming our full year revenue guidance of $9.7 billion to $10 billion. This revenue guidance reflects the strengthening of the U.S. dollar from January 1 through April 29, resulting in an estimated currency headwind of approximately $120 million, net of hedging activities. We are also reaffirming our full year non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance of $14.25 to $16 despite the $0.76 impact of Aduhelm inventory write-offs as well as an impact of approximately $0.35 related to the strengthening of the dollar that I just mentioned.
Although our prior guidance did not assume either the inventory write-offs or the currency headwinds, we believe the additional cost measures announced today as well as better performance in our base business can largely offset these impacts. This financial guidance assumes continued declines in RITUXAN revenue due to biosimilar competition as well as continued erosion of Tecfidera revenue in the U.S. due to generic entry. This guidance also continues to assume the potential entry of Tecfidera generics in the EU in the second quarter of 2022.
We expect to decrease revenue from these high-margin products as well as the Aduhelm inventory charges to reduce our gross margin percentage when compared with 2021. This guidance reflects the initial implementation of the additional cost reduction and productivity measures, which Michel discussed. These additional measures are expected to yield approximately $500 million in annualized savings in addition to the previously communicated initiatives already targeting approximately $500 million in annualized savings. This brings total expected annualized savings to approximately $1 billion, a portion of which will be reinvested in strategic initiatives over the coming years.
Please see our press release for other important guidance assumptions. So in summary, we continue to execute on our core business objectives this quarter and are now focused on a set of near-term operational priorities, which we believe can drive value creation over time. We'll now open the call for questions.",21.0,Medium
BIIB,2022,2,"Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Biogen second quarter earnings call and financial update. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Michael Hencke, head of investor relations.
We have also slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail.
The SKYLARK study met its primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints with a two-week course of 50 milligrams zuranolone, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in symptoms at day 15 as compared to placebo, the primary endpoint and at day three, day 28, and 45. This is the second positive phase 3 study of zuranolone in postpartum depression further reinforces the clinical profile of zuranolone that has been observed to date. Postpartum depression is one of the most common medical complications occurring during and after pregnancy, affecting an estimated 1 in 8 mothers or approximately 500,000 women in the United States each year. Depression, sadness, anxiety, thoughts of hurting oneself or one's infant, and thoughts of suicide are common signs associated with PPD.
Outside the U.S., TECFIDERA was modestly impacted by generic competition in markets such as Canada and Germany. At this point, we are aware of several generic applications that have approved in Europe, and we will be monitoring the situation closely. Importantly, we were pleased to be granted a new patent in the EU and reserve all rights to assert the patent against infringing, but it's possible that it may still be at risk. Global VUMERITY revenue of $137 million increased 51% at actual currency and 52% at constant currency.
VUMERITY continued to grow in the U.S. We are pleased with the trajectory. Outside the U.S., VUMERITY is now launched in 14 markets. We are currently working with our contract manufacturing suppliers potential supply constraints and have therefore delayed any additional country launches.
Global TYSABRI revenue of $516 million decreased 2% at actual currency and was flat at constant currency. In the United States, TYSABRI revenue was negatively impacted by modest volume declines, partially offset by favorable pricing. Outside the U.S., we were pleased to see continued patient growth. We are aware that regulatory filings for a biosimilar referencing TYSABRI have been submitted to both the FDA and the EMA.
Moving to SMA. Global SPINRAZA revenue of $431 million, declined 14% at actual currency and 11% at constant currency. In the U.S., we're encouraged to see fewer SPINRAZA discontinuations during the quarter. Outside the U.S., the revenue decline was primarily driven by competition and with the timing of shipments in certain markets, pricing dynamics and negative currency impacts.
Global SPINRAZA revenue decreased 9% versus the first quarter of 2022 at actual currency and 8% at constant currency, driven by competition and negative currency impacts outside the U.S., as well as some seasonality dynamics in the U.S. Moving to our biosimilars business. Revenue of $194 million declined 4% at actual currency, increased 3% at constant currency. Biosimilars volume increases were more than offset by negative currency impact and pricing pressure.
Revenue from OCREVUS royalties increased 14%, which was more than offset by continued RITUXAN declines due to biosimilar competition. Now moving on to expenses and the balance sheet. Second quarter non-GAAP R&D expense was $529 million, including $18 million in upfront payments related to operations with MedRhythms and Alectos Therapeutics. This is compared to $585 million in the second quarter of 2021, which included approximately $50 million in upfront payments.
Non-GAAP SG&A was $570 million, including approximately $29 million related to ADUHELM. This is compared to $635 million in the second quarter of 2021. Second quarter collaboration profit sharing was a net expense of $29 million, which includes $58 million of profit sharing expense related to the collaboration with Samsung Bioepis, partially offset by reimbursement of $29 million from Eisai related to commercialization of ADUHELM in the U.S. Non-GAAP other expense was $79 million, primarily driven by interest expense.
We repurchased 2.4 million shares of the company's common stock during the quarter for $500 million. As of June 30, we ended the quarter with $7.3 billion in debt, $5.9 billion in cash and marketable securities and $1.4 billion in net debt. In July, we repaid our senior notes due September 2022, with an aggregate principal amount of $1 billion. Of note, as of June 30, we utilized approximately $71 million of work in-process inventory related to lecanemab.
Specifically, subsequent to issuing our most recent guidance on May 3, we have experienced a headwind of approximately $55 million to revenue and $0.20 to EPS due to currency fluctuations from April 29 through July 15. This is in addition to a headwind of approximately $120 million to revenue and $0.35 to EPS due to currency fluctuations between January 1 and April 29. These currency headwinds are primarily due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which we transact.
This financial guidance assumes continued declines in RITUXAN revenue due to biosimilar competition as well as continued erosion of TECFIDERA revenue in the U.S. due to generic entry. Further, this guidance reflects a range of scenarios for the impact of TECFIDERA generics in the EU, which is difficult to predict. We are aware of a small number of generics that have launched to date, and we are monitoring the situation.
We assume we will utilize a portion of the remaining share repurchase authorization of $2.3 billion throughout the remainder of the year. Please see our press release for important guidance assumptions. In summary, we continue to execute well across our core business and are pleased to be raising our financial guidance for the year. We remain focused on delivering results and are optimistic about the potential opportunities ahead of us that we believe can create long-term value for shareholders.",21.0,Medium
BIIB,2022,3,"Good morning. My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Biogen third quarter 2022 earnings call and business update.  [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Hencke, head of investor relations.
I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I am joined by our chief executive officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Priya Singhal, interim head of research and development; and our CFO, Mike McDonnell.
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This is an exciting time for Biogen. In addition to key developments across our pipeline, which includes 12 programs in Phase III are filed, we continue to execute progress, and we are pleased to be raising our full year financial guidance. I would like to begin by reviewing the important advances we made this quarter and what we believe they mean for Biogen. Priya will then review our recent progress in R&D, and Mike will discuss our third quarter performance.
Total revenue for the third quarter was $2.5 billion, a decrease of 10% at actual currency and 8% at constant currency.  Non-GAAP diluted EPS in the third quarter was $4.77, which was flat versus the third quarter of 2021. Total MMS revenue, inclusive of OCREVUS royalties, was $1.6 billion, which was a decrease of 11% at actual currency and 9% at constant currency. Global TECFIDERA revenue of $339 million decreased 32% at actual currency and 30% at constant currency. We saw continued erosion of TECFIDERA in the U.S.
due to generics and an impact from generics outside of the U.S., primarily in Germany. We continue to see new generic launches in the EU. Earlier this month, the advocate general of the European Court of Justice issued a nonbinding advisory opinion. We would expect TECFIDERA to have statutory market protection until at least February of 2024 if the court adopts the advisory opinion.
There is no deadline for the court to issue its final decision, but we understand that approximately 3 to 5 months after issuance of the advocate general's opinion is typical. Separately, we are filing actions to enforce our recently granted European TECFIDERA dosing patent, which expires in 2028. We have been successful in obtaining preliminary injunctions in some countries and unsuccessful in others, including Germany and France. Until we either affirm TECFIDERA's entitlement to statutory market protection in the EU or successfully asserted our patent, generics can continue to sell in the countries where we do not have preliminary injunctions in place.
We continue to work with our contract manufacturing supplier to address potential supply constraints for VUMERITY. We have identified the root cause, implemented manufacturing changes required to resolve the issue, and are now working to secure necessary related regulatory approvals. We do not anticipate a supply shortage in 2022 and are currently focused on rebuilding adequate inventory with the goal of ensuring supply and reinitiating new country launches in 2023. Global TYSABRI revenue of $505 million decreased 3% at actual currency and 1% at constant currency.
In the United States, SPINRAZA revenue was flat versus the prior year, and we believe we may be seeing signs of stabilization in the U.S. Outside the U.S., excluding negative currency impacts, revenue increased due to volume growth in certain Asian markets as well as some positive pricing dynamics, partially offset by competition and the timing of shipments. Overall, we continue to believe that SPINRAZA has the potential to grow over time. Moving to our biosimilars business.
Revenue from OCREVUS royalties increased 6%, which was offset by continued RITUXAN declines due to biosimilar competition. Now moving on to expenses on the balance sheet. Third quarter non-GAAP cost of sales was $470 million, which includes $12 million of idle capacity charges. Going forward, we expect further pressure on gross margins due to shifts in product mix and potential idle capacity charges, largely resulting from the suspension of drug product manufacturing for Aduhelm.
Third quarter non-GAAP R&D expense was $549 million. This is compared to $702 million in the third quarter of 2021, which included approximately $165 million in upfront payments related to business development transactions as well as clinical trial closeout costs. Non-GAAP SG&A was $562 million. This is compared to $651 million in the third quarter of 2021.
The decrease in SG&A expense was driven primarily by cost savings initiatives. Third quarter collaboration profit sharing was a net expense of $45 million, primarily driven by our collaboration with Samsung Bioepis. Non-GAAP other expense was $55 million, primarily driven by interest expense. In the third quarter, we generated $661 million in cash flow from operations.
Let me now discuss our updated full year 2022 guidance. We are increasing our full year revenue guidance from our previous range of $9.9 billion to $10.1 billion to a new range of $10 billion to $10.115 billion and increasing our full year non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance from our previous range of $15.25 to $16.75 to a new range of $16.50 to $17.15. This guidance increase is primarily a result of better-than-expected top line performance and continued cost management. Our guidance ranges for non-GAAP R&D expense, non-GAAP SG&A expense, and our non-GAAP tax rate are all unchanged from prior guidance.
As a reminder, we typically see a seasonally higher SG&A spend in the fourth quarter. This guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates as of September 30 will remain in effect for the remainder of the year, net of hedging activities. This financial guidance also assumes continued declines in Rituxan revenue due to biosimilar competition, as well as continued erosion of TECFIDERA revenue due to generic entry. Please see our press release for other important guidance assumptions.
In summary, we continue to execute well across our core business and are pleased to be raising our financial guidance for the year. We are excited about the recent lecanemab readout and believe our diversified pipeline across neuroscience, specialized immunology, and biosimilars has the potential to return Biogen to growth over time as we continue to build a multi-franchise portfolio. As always, we remain focused on creating long-term value for our shareholders. And with that, we will now open the call for questions. ",21.0,Medium
BMY,2022,1,"Good day, and welcome to the Bristol-Myers Squibb 2022 first quarter results conference call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tim Power, vice president, investor relations.
Thank you, Sergei, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning for our first quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me this morning with prepared remarks are Giovanni Caforio, our board chair and chief executive officer; and David Elkins, our chief financial officer. Also participating in today's call are Chris Boerner, our chief commercialization officer; and Samit Hirawat, our chief medical officer and head of global drug development.
These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any future date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements even if our estimates change. We'll also focus our comments on our non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available on bms.com.
entry expectations remain the same, while ex U.S. erosion is expected to be faster than previously anticipated. Overall, we grew revenue by 5% and delivered double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth compared to the same quarter last year. There is good momentum in our business, and our performance in Q1 validates that we are well prepared for the renewal of our portfolio with multiple catalysts across in-line products and new product portfolio to more than offset upcoming LOEs and drive growth through the decade.
Our very strong financial position gives us significant flexibility as we continue to prioritize business development while paying down debt and expanding shareholder distributions. Now let me turn to our scorecard on Slide 5 and provide some context around the important achievements of the quarter. We are making good progress against our milestones, which are central to delivering on our long-term strategy and growth as a company. Starting with the milestones we show during the quarter.
Thanks to the hard work, dedication and strong execution by our employees, I am confident in our ability to deliver on our strategy and more than offset key LOEs by continuing the growth of our in-line products with $8 billion to $10 billion in incremental sales and delivering $10 billion to $13 billion of revenue expected from our new product portfolio by 2025. Our strong clinical performance further derisks our launch portfolio. And as a result, we have confidence in our ability to deliver the $25 billion plus in nonrisk-adjusted revenue in 2029. We have a strong foundation in place.
This was driven by strong double-digit sales of our in-line and new product portfolio, partially offset by our recent LOEs. Let's take a closer look at our new product portfolio performance on Slide 10. In the first quarter, the new product portfolio contributed $350 million in revenue, more than doubling revenue versus prior year. With the combination of factors, including the usual year-end buying patterns impacting sequential performance, we remain confident in the growth potential of the new product portfolio.
Internationally, Zeposia continues to secure reimbursement in other markets for MS as well as obtain additional reimbursement for the newly approved UC indication last quarter. Lastly, as we continue to broaden our immunology portfolio, launch plans are already underway to prepare for deucravacitinib's upcoming PDUFA date in September. Now, let's turn to our first quarter P&L on Slide 15. As noted recently, we changed the presentation of our non-GAAP results.
Net charges of $280 million consisting of acquired in-process R&D charges offset by licensing income are primarily driven by upfront milestone payments associated with the Immatics and Dragonfly licensing agreements. The first quarter effective tax rate was impacted by earnings mix. Even with this new financial presentation and the $0.10 impact from the inclusion of acquired in-process R&D and previously specified income, our strong performance in the quarter allowed us to grow non-GAAP EPS 13% versus last year. Excluding this, the new presentation chain of non-GAAP EPS would have grown 18%.
Now moving to the balance sheet and capital allocation on Slide 16. Cash flow generation for the company remained strong. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was approximately $3.8 billion. We ended the quarter in a strong liquidity position with approximately $15 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Recent LOE product guidance is also being changed to reflect the updated Revlimid outlook in the range of $9 billion to $9.5 billion. So FX headwinds impact our entire portfolio. The outlook for in-line products and the new product portfolio remains unchanged. This reflects the strong performance and confidence in our future growth drivers.
I'm just wondering how you see that impacting any uptake the drug could have? And the second question for me was on Milvexian and just the read across from the Bayer Factor XIa data we saw last month. I guess specific question would be, can you just talk about the attractiveness of Afib as a category for the Factor XIa's? And is that a focus for Bristol? Or is your focus more in markets where there currently isn't, I guess, Factor Xa usage? So any color there would be appreciated.",23.0,Medium
BMY,2022,2,"Good day, and welcome to the Bristol-Myers Squibb second quarter results conference call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tim Power, vice president, investor relations.
You'll note that we posted slides to bms.com that you can use to follow along with for Giovanni and David's remarks. Before we get started, I'll read our forward-looking statement. During this call, we will make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's SEC filings.
These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimate as of any future date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements, even if our estimates change. We'll also focus our comments on our non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at bms.com.
Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with our second-quarter performance on Slide 4. We are midway through 2022 and we've made great progress during an important year for the company. We continued to grow our in-line franchises, expand our new product portfolio, advance our pipeline, and execute important business development activities.
Our foundation is strong and positions us well for growth. With respect to our commercial performance, we delivered continued sales growth with revenue up 5%, adjusting for foreign exchange and non-GAAP EPS increasing by 18%. The strong revenue growth was driven by excellent commercial execution with solid year-over-year growth for our in-line brands, particularly for Eliquis and our I-O franchise, and significant momentum from our new product portfolio. Within our new product portfolio Opdualag, our third I-O agent, is off to a great start and we are pleased with the team's early execution.
Opdualag strengthens our position in I-O and accelerates the sustainability and growth of our I-O franchise. We are also establishing a strong foundation for Camzyos as the first agent that effectively treats the underlying condition of symptomatic obstructive HCM. We see a lot of potential to drive significant penetration in this large, underserved, and underdiagnosed population. We also made great progress advancing our broad set of pipeline opportunities through regulatory approvals and clinical trial readouts during the quarter.
I remain excited about the multiple opportunities we have across our pipeline, and I look forward to continuing to update you on our progress. As I review our performance during the first half of 2022, I'm very proud of the employees of Bristol-Myers Squibb around the world. Together, we have built the foundation for an even stronger company with a more diversified portfolio of growth products and increased durability across each of our four key therapeutic areas. Our performance in the quarter continues to demonstrate the resiliency of our business and our continued financial strength.
We believe this positions us well to continue to grow our business in an increasingly complex external environment. This includes macroeconomic factors such as the strengthening U.S. dollar and accelerating inflation, as well as legislative headwinds in the U.S. Given our growing and rapidly diversifying business and our continued financial flexibility, we remain very well-positioned for the future.
This performance is driven by robust growth of our inline and new product portfolio of 16% more than offsetting our recent LOEs. Let's now double click on our new product portfolio performance on Slide 9. Global revenues were nearly $500 million, more than doubling revenue versus prior year. Growth over prior quarter was also very strong, up 38%, primarily due to strong launches of Abecma and Opdualag, which I will touch on in a moment.
I'm very pleased with the performance of our new product portfolio and its future potential with two additional launches year to date and deucravacitinib's anticipated approval in six weeks, our new product portfolio significant expansion opportunities, and the potential to generate greater than $25 billion in revenue on a non-risk-adjusted basis in 2029. I look forward to updating you on these products as they continue to realize their full potential. The performance of our solid tumor portfolio as shown on Slide 10 was strong. Opdivo sales in the quarter continue to grow globally, driven by demand for our newly launched and core indications.
In the U.S., while we did experience demand softness from the volume generic entry in the quarter, we understand that specialty pharmacies are mainly utilizing the current generic for new patients to ensure continuity of treatment. As mentioned in the past, we know there will be variability quarter to quarter based on how generics will deploy their volume. As additional entrants will be coming to the market in the U.S. in the third quarter, we expect Q3 revenues to be approximately $2.1 billion.
Acquired in-process R&D charges in the quarter were $400 million, primarily driven by the buyout of a royalty obligation for Camzyos of $295 million as well as a $90 million upfront for BridgeBio. This accounted for a 17% impact to diluted EPS. Acquired in-process R&D charges in the prior year were approximately $793 million, which accounted for a $0.30 impact to diluted EPS. The second quarter tax rate was impacted by earnings mix.
And lastly, we delivered strong non-GAAP EPS growth in the quarter, up 18% year over year. This includes the $0.14 impact of acquired in-process R&D. Excluding acquired in-process R&D, non-GAAP EPS would have grown 7%. Now moving to the balance sheet and capital allocation on Slide 15.
The company's balance sheet remains strong with $13.2 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand as of June 30. Cash flow from operations in the first half of the year was $6.1 billion. In the quarter, it was approximately $2.3 billion, which is impacted by a cash tax payment, and we expect cash flow from operations to rebound in Q3 and Q4. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged.",23.0,Medium
BMY,2022,3,"Also participating in today's call are Chris Boerner, our chief commercialization officer; and Samit Hirawat, our chief medical officer and head of global drug development. As you'll know, we've posted slides to bms.com that you can follow along with for Giovanni and David's remarks. But before we get going, I'll read our forward-looking statement. During this call, we'll make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements.
Thank you, Tim. And good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 4. I'm pleased to share that we delivered another good quarter, and we continue to advance our strategy to position Bristol Myers Squibb for sustainable growth.
Our diversified in-line and new product portfolio grew strongly, up 13%, offsetting the impact of our recent LOEs. Now, let me touch on a performance of our new product portfolio on Slide 11. Global revenues were over $550 million, up 66% versus prior year, driven by continued demand. Growth over prior quarter was also strong, up 16%.
We continue to be very pleased that the performance of our new product portfolio and its future potential. With three new launch brands this year and over $2 billion of annualized revenue so far, our portfolio has been largely derisk, increasing our confidence in the potential to generate greater than $25 billion of nonrisk adjusted revenues in 2029. Turning to Slide 12 to discuss our performance of our solid tumor portfolio, Opdivo sales continue to grow globally, up 13%, driven by demand for newly launched import indications. In the U.S., sales were strong.
As expected, sequential performance was driven by the typical dynamics we experienced each year, from higher gross-to-net payments as patients enter the donut hole. Internationally, Eliquis has become a leading OAC across numerous countries. Given the success of the product, the pricing pressures, as expected, impede growth. Pricing measures, in addition to at-risk generic entry in the U.K.
Excluding acquired in-process R&D, operating expenses were broadly in line with prior year and affected by the timing of spend. Acquired in-process R&D charges in the quarter were $30 million related to an upfront payment to GentiBio. This is offset by $73 million of licensing income, benefiting OI&E in the quarter. The third quarter effective tax rate was 16.9%, driven by earnings mix.
And overall, we delivered another quarter of earnings growth with non-GAAP earnings per share growing 3% versus prior year. Moving to the balance sheet and capital allocation on Slide 17, cash flow from operations in the quarter were $3.7 billion. The company's balance sheet remains strong, with approximately $9 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand as of September 30th, which also accounts for the $3.3 billion we paid for Turning Point Therapeutics. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged.
We continue to expect revenues to be approximately $46 billion with our in-line and new product portfolio growing in the low double-digit range. Our recent LOE guidance and Revlimid guidance remain unchanged. However, as mentioned earlier, we expect Revlimid sales to be in the upper end of the $9 billion to $9.5 billion range. We continue to expect gross margin to be approximately 79%.",23.0,Medium
BMY,2022,4,"Good morning. My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Bristol-Myers Squibb fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Power, vice president of investor relations.
Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning for our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me this morning with prepared remarks are Giovanni Caforio, our board chair and chief executive officer; and David Elkins, our chief financial officer. Also participating in today's call are Chris Boerner, our chief commercialization officer; and Samit Hirawat, our chief medical officer and head of global drug development.
These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any future date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements even if our estimates change. We'll also focus our comments on our non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at bms.com.
So I am pleased to note that we delivered continued strong growth in the fourth quarter for these assets, up 12% adjusting for foreign exchange. We also grew our earnings, including non-GAAP EPS growth of 8% for the full year. As we start 2023, I am confident we have established a strong foundation for Bristol-Myers Squibb. As you will note from our guidance, we expect to grow both revenue and non-GAAP EPS this year.
Importantly, we remain on track to achieve the commitments we have made for 2025. Given increasing confidence in our new product portfolio and continued progress with our broader pipeline, we see multiple paths to growth through 2030. Let me now provide some perspective on 2022. On Slide 5, you can see our overall pipeline execution last year.
As you can also see on this slide, we continue to see exciting catalysts ahead for these assets. So turning to our scorecard for this year on Slide 7. It's encouraging to observe the breadth of catalysts we see ahead as a company in the near term. I'll point out a few highlights.
Turning to Slide 8. I'd like to remind you about what we've accomplished in the past few years and how that prepares us well for the near, mid, and long term. When we began the transformation of our company three years ago, we told you what we believed we could achieve and we have delivered across the board. Financially, we have grown our company, over delivered synergies, reduced our debt, and generated significant cash flows.
As you know, we expect to drive growth through 2025 and sustain strong profitability as we transform our portfolio. And that journey continues this year. We delivered growth through Revlimid generics in 2022. And as you can see from our guidance today, we expect to continue to grow this year.
With the focus turning to the second half of the decade, we continue to see multiple paths to growth, driven by growth of the new products, contribution from our advancing late-stage pipeline, including milvexian LPA1 and the CELMoDs, and significant optionality from our early pipeline, complemented by flexibility for additional business development. All the while, we are transforming our portfolio to be younger, more diversified, and more resilient in the face of an increasingly complex pricing environment in the U.S. and internationally. Before I turn to David, let me express my gratitude to our teams across the globe, starting with our research and development organization, which had a stellar 2022.
Unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are made versus the same period in 2021 and sales performance growth rates will be discussed on an underlying basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. We delivered on our full year commitments with sales of approximately $46 billion with growth of 3%. Demand for our diversified in-line and new product portfolio was strong, with revenue growth of 13% for the year, more than offsetting the loss of exclusivity for Revlimid in the first year of generic entry. Let me dive deeper now into fourth quarter and full year performance of our new product portfolio on Slide 12.
Global revenues in the quarter were $645 million, up 87%, while full year revenues topped over $2 billion, nearly doubling over 2021. With nine new product approvals and multiple additional indications coming to fruition, we have an increasingly de-risked new product portfolio. This provides us confidence that we are on track to deliver the potential of our new product portfolio with $25 billion of non-risk-adjusted revenue expected at the end of the decade. Moving to Slide 13 to discuss our performance of our solid tumor portfolio.
In the U.S., fourth quarter sales increased 15%, driven primarily by demand and favorable gross-to-net adjustments. Internationally, Eliquis is the leading OAC in many countries. Given high market shares across these countries, demand growth has been offset by pricing measures as well as generic entry in Canada, the U.K., and the Netherlands. Now turning to our first-in-class myosin inhibitor, Camzyos.
Having just covered sales performance, let me walk you through a few non-GAAP key line items. As expected, fourth quarter gross margin was impacted primarily by product mix and higher manufacturing costs. For the full year, gross margin was in line with our prior guidance at approximately 79%. Excluding acquired in-process R&D, fourth quarter and full year operating expenses decreased primarily due to reallocation of investments behind our growth opportunities and the impact from foreign exchange and dilution from the Turning Point acquisition.
Acquired in-process R&D in the quarter was $52 million, which was partially offset by $16 million of licensing income that benefited OI&E in the quarter. Fourth quarter effective tax rate was approximately 11%, driven by earnings mix and onetime items with the full year tax rate of approximately 15%. Overall, fourth quarter earnings per share was $1.82. From a full year perspective, we ended the year at the upper end of our guidance range at $7.70, representing 8% over previous year.
Moving to the balance sheet and capital allocation on Slide 18. Cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was $3.3 billion. The company's balance sheet remains strong with approximately $9 billion of cash and marketable securities on hand as of December 31st. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged.
And finally, as it relates to returning capital to shareholders, we have a long-standing track record of paying dividend for 91 consecutive years and recently grew the dividend for the 14th consecutive year. We remain committed to growing the dividend, subject to Board approval and continue to be opportunistic on share repurchases, with approximately $7 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization. Let me close with our 2023 non-GAAP guidance on Slide 19. Due to unpredictable macroeconomic factors and large swings in foreign exchange last year, we are providing guidance on a reported basis as well as an underlying basis, which assumes currency remains consistent with prior year.
We expect 2023 revenues to grow approximately 2% on a reported and constant currency basis. This reflects our confidence that our in-line and new product portfolios will more than offset the LOE impact from Revlimid and Abraxane. We expect Revlimid sales to be approximately $6.5 billion, which assumes additional step-up to generic manufacturers later in Q1 as well as continued variability quarter to quarter. With the momentum of our new product portfolio, we expect it to roughly double versus last year and will be approximately $4 billion.
As it relates to our line item guidance for the year, we expect our gross margin to be approximately 77%, which reflects a shift in product mix. We do not predict acquired in-process R&D. So excluding this, we expect our total operating expenses to decline in the low single-digit range. This reflects a reallocation of cost and efficiency initiatives in MS&A as we continue to invest in our new launches.
R&D expenses are expected to be largely in line with last year due to our dynamic portfolio of studies reading out and new study starts. We project our tax rate to be approximately 17%, reflecting changes to Puerto Rico tax laws and product mix. Finally, we expect to grow our non-GAAP earnings per share with a range of $7.95 to $8.25. This represents growth of approximately 5%.
Excluding prior year acquired in-process R&D, adjusted EPS would grow approximately 2%. So before we move over to Q&A, I want to thank our colleagues around the world for the strong performance in 2022. Our strong execution in 2022 and our commitments for 2023 reflects the resiliency of our business and the renewal of our product portfolio. The performance in the year positions us well for long-term growth.",23.0,Medium
BSX,2022,1,"Good morning, and welcome to the Boston Scientific first quarter 2022 earnings call. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Lauren Tengler, vice president, investor relations. Please go ahead.
We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the investor relations section of our website under the heading, financials and filings. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Michael focused his comments on Q1 performance, as well as future catalysts and the outlook for our business, including Q2 2022 and full year '22 guidance. Dan will review the financials for the quarter, provide more details regarding our Q2 and full year 2022 guidance.
In the first quarter '22, total company operational sales grew 13% versus prior year, while organic sales grew 10% above the high end of our guidance range of 5 to 8. Importantly, this performance was strong across all regions, and we anticipate that most all of our businesses grew at or faster than their respective markets. First quarter adjusted EPS of $0.39 grew 6.5% versus prior year, achieving the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.38 to $0.40. And despite continued macroeconomic headwinds and resulting supply chain pressure, first quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.8%, which is higher than anticipated due to the overachievement of sales and lower spend.
While we anticipate less of a global COVID impact and underlying procedure volumes for full year '22 versus '21, we continue to provide a wider guidance range to account for uncertainty related to COVID waves, staffing challenges, and supply chain pressures. However, we are increasing our full year 2022 operational growth to 9% to 11% and organic growth to 6.5% to 8.5%. For second quarter '22 revenue, we are guiding to operational growth of 6 to 9 and organic growth of 3 to 6. We're also updating our full year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance to a $1.74 to $1.79, and our second quarter adjusted EPS estimate to $0.41 to $0.43.
Additionally, we received approval in Canada for LithoView Elite, which is our next-generation flexible single-use ureteroscope, with advanced imaging and internal renal pressure-sensing capabilities. Turning to our Endoscopy business, sales grew nicely, 9% organic versus prior year. The underlying business remains very strong, and we continue to innovate with new product offerings, supporting continued above-market growth. We're seeing momentum across our franchises, including biliary hemostasis and our single-use imaging franchise as the SpyGlass DS visualization system continues to have strong growth, while our newer single-use scopes are gaining scale.
Boston Scientific's dedicated transforming lives through innovative medical solutions, while also minimizing the impact of the environment and making measurable contribution to the world. Corporate responsibility is core to our values and helps inform our priorities that advanced progress and aligned to our business goals. So, we're excited to share our progress in the 2021 performance report, which we expect to release in May. Also in 2021, we announced five acquisitions, strengthening our underlying market growth with innovative technologies and accretive growth markets.
In 2022, we evolved our leadership structure to enhance customer focus and further enable our strategies. Joe Fitzgerald now leads the Cardiology segment, including interventional cardiology therapies, WATCHMAN, CRM Diagnostics, and electrophysiology; and Art Butcher now leads the MedSurg segment, including endoscopy, urology, and neuromodulation, while continuing to oversee Asia-Pac. This new structure supports agile business practices and drives collaboration and innovation across our similar call points, while also empowering our leaders to maintain our deep customer focus. We're excited about the outlook for 2022 and our long-range plans despite the macroeconomic challenges we continue to face.
We remain committed to our financial goals, growing sales faster than the market, continuing operating margin expansion, and double-digit adjusted EPS growth with strong adjusted free cash flow. I'm extremely grateful to our employees for their resiliency, the strong results, and their winning spirit. And now I'll turn things over to Dan to review our financial performance in more detail.
Included in the $0.39 was a $0.02 headwind from tax and below the line. Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 70.3%. We expect Q2 adjusted gross margin to be in line with Q1 as we continue to face macroeconomic headwinds and resulting pressures on the global supply chain. Despite our expectation that these macroeconomic headwinds will continue throughout 2022, we anticipate a slight improvement to adjusted gross margin in the second half with the full realization of standard cost improvements and less unfavorable manufacturing variances.
We now expect our full year adjusted gross margin to be in line with the second half of 2021 adjusted gross margin of 70.8%, which reflects an approximate $300 million headwind versus pre-COVID levels with nearly half of this headwind related to increased freight costs and the remaining headwind resulting from unfavorable manufacturing variances, driven by the availability of direct materials and the increased cost to procure them. First quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.8%, slightly higher than our expectations, driven by top-line revenue performance and disciplined spend management in the quarter. We continue to anticipate our full year adjusted operating margin to be within a range of 26% to 26.4%. Given the magnitude and level of persistence of the macroeconomic headwinds, it likely makes the high end of our adjusted operating margin guidance range, less certain, but we still believe the range is achievable.
And on a GAAP basis, first quarter operating margin was 15.4%. Moving to below the line, adjusted interest and other expense totaled $110 million in Q1, slightly higher than our expectations, and, based on the timing of our debt refinancing within the quarter, included minimal benefit from the debt transaction, which I'll provide further detail on in a moment. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 14.3% on an adjusted basis, including unfavorable discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Excluding these items, our operational tax rate was 13.9%, higher than our expectations, driven by differences in the treatment of interest expense in the issuing jurisdiction of our euro-denominated bonds.
We ended Q1 with 1,438 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Our adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $70 million, and free cash flow was an outflow of $171 million with a $58 million outflow from operating activities and $113 million of net capital expenditures. For full year 2022 adjusted free cash flow, we continue to aim to be at or above 2021 adjusted free cash flow of $2.2 billion. As of March 31, 2022, we had cash on hand of $325 million after closing the acquisition of Baylis Medical in February.
We expect second quarter 2022 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 6% to 9% versus 2021, which excludes an approximate 300 basis-point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates and includes a 300 basis-point contribution from the acquisitions of Farapulse, Lumenis, and Baylis. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, we expect second quarter 2022 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 3% to 6% against a much tougher Q2 comp. We now expect our full year 2022 adjusted below-the-line expenses to be approximately $360 million, down from the $400 million guidance issued in February due to lower interest expense as a result of our debt refinancing transaction, partially offset by the cost to manage our VC portfolio and execute our hedging program. As a result of the difference in tax treatment of interest expense related to our debt refinancing transaction, we now expect our full year 2022 operational tax rate to be approximately 14% with an adjusted tax rate of approximately 13%, including the benefit of the accounting standard for stock compensation.",26.0,Medium
BSX,2022,2,"Good morning, and welcome to the Boston Scientific second quarter 202 earnings call. [Operator instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Lauren Tengler, vice president, investor relations. Please go ahead.
We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the investor relations section of our website under the heading financials and filings. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will focus his comments on Q2 performance as well as future catalysts and the outlook for our business, including Q3 2022 and full year 2022 guidance. Dan will review the financials for the quarter, provide more details regarding our Q3 and full year guidance, and then we'll take your questions.
Relevant acquisitions excluded for the organic growth or Preventice, FARAPULSE and Lumina Surgical which closed in March, August and September of 2021, respectively; as well as Baylis Medical, which closed on February 14, 2022. Divestitures include the BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals, which closed on March 1, 2021. Guidance excludes the recently announced agreement to purchase the majority stake of MI Tech, which is expected to close in the second half of 2022. For more information, please refer to our financial and operating highlights deck, which may be found on our investor relations website.
Our first half revenue performance was 8.1%, and we anticipate growth to accelerate in the second half, and therefore, we are increasing our full year '22 guidance for operational growth from 10.5 to 11 and a half percent, and organic growth to plus 8% to 9%. For third quarter '22 revenue, we're guiding to operational growth of 10% to 12% and organic growth of 8% to 10%. We aim to improve operating margins in 2022. However, with the ongoing impact of supply chain challenges, we are updating our adjusted operating margin to 26% to 26.2% for the full year as a result of FX volatility and additional supply chain-related operating margin pressure.
In core CRM, we anticipate that our growth was at or above the market with our low-voltage business growing mid-single digits and our high-voltage business growing low single digits. Our S-ICD franchise continues to perform well, further supported by positive data from the investigator-sponsored ATLAS trial presented at HRS earlier this year. The ATLAS trial compared EMBLEM S-ICD to single-chamber transvenous ICD devices and demonstrated similar protection from sudden death and superiority from serious lead-related complications at six months. Our diagnostics business continues to perform well outpacing the market, driven by the Preventice portfolio and our implantable cardiac LUX-Dx.
In peripheral interventions, organic sales grew 6% versus prior year. Within the arterial franchise, we had another very strong quarter of double-digit growth in the drug-eluting portfolio as Ranger and Eluvia solidify their positions in key global markets. In Venous, the U.S. clot management business was impacted in the quarter by both the transient impact of the contrast shortage as well as by competition, largely offset by strength in Varithena sales as we continue to expand market share with our innovative offering.
Earlier this quarter, we issued our annual performance report which showcases our commitment to corporate responsibility and progress toward our longer-term goals. In this report, we highlight key metrics in support of our efforts include performance against our first human capital scorecard, which tracks companywide goals and is part of the company's annual bonus plan. You can access this report at any time through our investor relations website. We're very pleased with our first half results and outlook for '22 and beyond despite the macroeconomic challenges we continue to face.
Our innovative portfolio, category leadership strategy, commercial execution and commitment to ongoing clinical evidence positions us well today and into the future. We look forward to hosting an investor event at TCT this September. We'll provide more details as they're available. While the macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging, we remain committed to our long-term financial goals, continuing to grow sales faster than underlying markets, operating margin expansion, double-digit adjusted EPS growth and strong adjusted free cash flow.
This incremental $75 million brings the total headwind versus 2019 to $375 million. Recall this headwind is primarily driven by inflationary pressures on direct materials, freight and labor costs, as well as inefficiencies in our manufacturing plants due to material availability. We now expect our full year adjusted gross margin to be slightly below the second half of 2021 adjusted gross margin of 70.8%. We anticipate a slight improvement to adjusted gross margin in the second half due to the full realization of standard cost improvements consistent with historical trends, as well as an FX tailwind from the stronger U.S.
dollar. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.2%, resulting in a first half adjusted operating margin of 25.5%. As a result of the increased macroeconomic pressures on gross margin, we now anticipate our full year adjusted operating margin to be within a range of to 26% to 26.2%. Despite these macroeconomic headwinds, we're focused on margin improvement versus the second half 2021 average of 25.9% with our range representing 10 to 30 basis points of operating margin expansion.
On a GAAP basis, second quarter operating margin was 13%, including a charge related to ongoing IP litigation. Moving to below the line, adjusted interest and other expense totaled $74 million in the quarter, lower than our expectations driven in part by a onetime FX gain from certain unhedged currencies. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 12.8% on an adjusted basis, including discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Excluding these items, our operational tax rate was 14.3% in line with our expectations.
Our top priority for capital allocation remains high-quality tuck-in M&A, and we'll continue to assess opportunities in conjunction with our financial goals. We continue to expect leverage of two and a half times by year-end 2022. And as of June 30, our leverage was 2.6 times. I'll now walk through guidance for Q3 and for the full year 2022.
We now expect our full year 2022 adjusted below-the-line expenses to be approximately $350 million, reflecting the FX gain recognized in Q2. We continue to expect our full year 2022 operational tax rate to be 14%, with an adjusted tax rate of approximately 13% including the benefit of the accounting standard for stock compensation and discrete tax items recognized in the first half of the year. As a reminder, our tax rate reflects current legislation, including a provision on the treatment of R&D expenditures. We continue to believe there is bipartisan support to reverse this provision, and if such legislation were to be enacted, we would expect our full year tax rate to revert to its historic range of approximately 11% operational and 10% adjusted, resulting in a $0.06 earnings per share benefit.
We expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1,442 billion shares for Q3 and 1,441 billion shares for the full year 2022. As a result of continued uncertainty within the macroeconomic environment as well as FX volatility we are narrowing our full year adjusted earnings per share range to $1.74 to $1.77. And for the third quarter, expect to be in a range of $0.43 to $0.45 and. Please check our investor relations website for Q2 2022 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more detailed Q2 results.",26.0,Medium
CINF,2022,1,"Thank you all for standing by, and welcome to the CINF first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions]. Please also note that today's call is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to your host, Dennis McDaniel, investor relations officer.
Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter-end investment portfolio.
At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including chief investment officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Cincinnati insurance's president, Steve Spray; chief claims officer, Marc Schambow; and senior vice president of corporate finance, Theresa Hoffer. First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC.
Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP. Now I'll turn it over the call to Steve. 
We reported a net loss of $273 million for the quarter, due to the recognition of a reduction in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio. Non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter of 2022 was up $31 million or 14% versus a year ago. Our 89.9% first quarter property casualty combined ratio was 1.3 percentage points better than last year's first quarter. The current accident year loss and loss expense ratio before catastrophe loss effects rose slightly compared with accident year 2021 measured at three months, reflecting an increase in large losses for our property lines of business.
We again managed our business to healthy levels of policy retention with meaningful average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty insurance segments. Policy retention rates for both commercial and personal lines improved from a year ago to the upper 80% range. Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 12% for the first quarter of 2022. Our pricing segmentation efforts continue to support what we believe is profitable growth as our underwriters work to retain and write more profitable accounts while taking appropriate action on opportunities that we determine have inadequate pricing.
We also believe renewal pricing during the first quarter was again ahead of our estimate for prospective loss cost trends for each property casualty segment. Our commercial lines insurance segment continued to experience estimated average renewal price increases in the mid-single-digit percentage range, similar to the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, personal lines average renewal price increases slowed by a small amount compared to the fourth quarter, remaining in the low single-digit range. Our excess and surplus lines insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range.
Our commercial lines segment grew first quarter 2022 net written premiums by 8% and with a combined ratio of 92.3%. Our personal lines segment, net written premium grew 11%, reflecting our continued planned expansion of high net worth business produced by our agencies. The segment's first year -- first quarter combined ratio of 83.9%, improved 17.2 percentage points from a year ago, driven by lower catastrophe losses. Our excess and surplus lines segment had an 85.9% combined ratio and continued strong growth with first quarter 2022 net write premiums rising by 25%.
The Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global, each had a nice quarter with healthy growth. Cincinnati Re grew net written premiums by 30% for the first quarter of 2022 with a combined ratio in the mid-90% range. Cincinnati Global, grew net written premiums by 24%, with a combined ratio also in the mid-90% range. Our life insurance subsidiary generated first quarter 2022 net income of $10 million, matching last year's first quarter and grew term life insurance earned premiums by 6%.
The average pre-tax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the first quarter of 2022 was 3.64%. We again purchased additional fixed maturity securities with net purchases during the quarter totaling $109 million. Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the first quarter of 2022 were unfavorable in aggregate for both our stockholdings and our bond holdings. The overall net decrease was approximately $1.4 billion before tax effects, including a net decrease of $746 million for unrealized gains in our bond portfolio.
The first quarter 2022 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 2.2 percentage points higher than last year. Most of the increase was from higher accruals for profit sharing commissions for agencies and related expenses. Regarding loss reserves, we aim for a consistent approach by targeting net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves.   As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. During the first quarter of 2022, we experienced $41 million of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years have benefited the combined ratio by 2.5 percentage points.
In recent years, we've experienced significant growth in commercial umbrella coverage within our commercial casualty lines of business, including 16% in 2021 and as industry pricing for umbrella has been strong. Umbrella losses tend to be frequently relatively infrequent with high severity and we recently experienced an elevated level of large losses, particularly for accident year 2019. Due to increased uncertainty for our umbrella business, we strengthened reserves for certain accident years and estimated ultimate losses for accident year 2022 at what we believe is a prudent level. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the quarter was favorable by $46 million for 2021, $24 million for 2022, unfavorable by 2020 by $28 million for 2019, and unfavorable by $1 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2019.
Life insurance operations increased book value $0.06. Investment income, other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items added $0.53. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value per share by $3.67. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio decreased book value by $3.33.
And we declared $0.69 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $6.29 per share during the first quarter to $75.43 per share. And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve.",26.0,Medium
CINF,2022,2,"Hello, and welcome to the Cincinnati Financial second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, investor relations officer. Please go ahead.
Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel, investor relations officer at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter end investment portfolio.
At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including president, Steve Spray; executive vice president and chief investment officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Cincinnati Insurance's chief claims officer, Marc Schambow; and senior vice president of corporate finance, Theresa Hoffer. First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC.
Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP. Now I'll turn over the call to Steve. 
Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our second quarter results. Increased catastrophe losses and increasing inflation affecting the industry, pressured our property casualty insurance results for this quarter. We are well positioned to improve results through continued focus on pricing and risk selection.
As we have in the past, we'll follow our proven formula to successfully analyze and address challenged areas of our insurance operations. Our financial strength remains excellent, and we are confident we can achieve profitable growth over the long term and through all economic cycles. We reported a net loss of $800 million -- $808 million for the quarter due to the recognition of a reduction in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio. Non-GAAP operating income of $104 million for the second quarter of 2022 was down from last year's impressive $292 million, largely due to catastrophe losses that were $119 million higher on an after-tax basis.
Our 103.2% second quarter property casualty combined ratio was 17.7 percentage points higher than the 85.5% posted second quarter of last year. That increase reflected higher catastrophe losses and less favorable results on both the prior accident year and current year -- current accident year basis. We regularly disclose large losses exceeding $1 million for individual property casualty claims, excluding losses from catastrophes. Commercial property and commercial umbrella tend to account for the bulk of those losses, each typically about one-third of total large losses.
We noted on our last call that commercial property large losses rose sharply in the first quarter of this year. That increase reversed in the second quarter when they declined 86% from the second quarter of 2021. For our personal lines segment, net written premiums grew 16%, sorry. However, in the second quarter, commercial umbrella losses rose significantly, prompting reserve additions that we detailed in our 10-Q.
Our commercial lines insurance segment continued to experience estimated average renewal price increases in the mid-single-digit percentage range, similar to the first quarter. Our excess and surplus lines Insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range. Personal lines average renewal price increases were slightly higher than in the first quarter, remaining in the low single-digit range. Personal auto is an area where we plan to more aggressively raise rates in future quarters as we work to improve its loss ratio.
Underwriting processes, design to help premiums keep pace with rising property values, whether from outsized inflation or other changes in insured exposure amounts are another reason for significant increases in 2022 renewal written premiums. Our commercial lines segment grew second quarter renewal premiums by 10%, and our personal lines segment also grew second quarter renewal premiums by 10%. The commercial lines segment grew second quarter 2022 net written premiums by 10% with a combined ratio of 106.3, including higher-than-usual catastrophe losses and elevated inflation effects. For our personal lines segment, net written premiums grew 16%, mostly from our continued planned expansion of high net worth business produced by our agencies.
Its second quarter combined ratio up 112.1% also included higher-than-usual catastrophe losses and elevated inflation effects. The second quarter provided another example of the benefits of improving diversification over time by product line and geography. Profitability was very good for our operations in excess and surplus lines insurance, reinsurance, global specialty insurance, and life insurance. Our excess and surplus line segment had an 85.1% combined ratio and continued strong growth with second quarter 2022 net written premiums growing 17%.
Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global each continued a pattern of profitable growth. Cincinnati Re, grew net written premiums by 31% for the second quarter of 2022, with a combined ratio in the low 80% range. Cincinnati Global, grew net written premium by 47%, with a combined ratio below 70%. Our life insurance subsidiary had another good quarter with net income of $21 million and a 91% increase in operating income, along with growth in term life insurance earned premiums of 8%.
Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the second quarter of 2022 were unfavorable in aggregate, for both our stock and bond holdings. The overall net decrease was approximately $1.8 billion before tax effects, including a net decrease of $610 million for unrealized gains in our bond portfolio. At the end of the quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $4.7 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $5.3 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $564 million.
Most of the decrease was from lower accruals for profit sharing commissions for agencies and related expenses. Moving on to loss reserves. We aim for a consistent approach by targeting net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business.
Next, I'll comment briefly on capital management. We've had a consistent approach that includes share repurchases as part of maintenance intended to offset shares issued through equity compensation plans. At the same time, changing circumstances or opportunities can influence us to repurchase more or less than historical averages. We continue to believe that we have plenty of financial flexibility and that our financial strength at the end of the quarter was excellent.
Property casualty underwriting decreased book value by $0.26. Life insurance operations increased book value by $0.13. Investment income, other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items headed $0.53. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value per share by $3.03.
Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio decreased book value by $5.81, and we declared $0.69 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $9.13 per share during the second quarter to $66.30 per share. And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve.
Thanks, Mike. While this wasn't the kind of quarter we want to have, one quarter doesn't sway us from our long-term strategies and objectives. Our financial strength remains excellent, and we are optimistic about the future. In the last month, three different third-party organizations agreed.",26.0,Medium
CINF,2022,3,"Good morning, and welcome to the Cincinnati Financial third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, investor relations officer. Please go ahead.
Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter-end investment portfolio.
At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including president, Steve Spray; senior vice president of investments, Steve Soloria; and Cincinnati Insurance's chief claims officer, Marc Schambow; and senior vice president of corporate finance, Theresa Hoffer. First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC.
Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP. Now, I'll turn over the call to Steve. 
Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to hear more about our third quarter results. In addition to market volatility affecting the valuation of our investment portfolio, elevated inflation and natural catastrophe events affecting the industry also continued to pressure our property casualty insurance results. We remain well positioned to improve performance through ongoing focus on successfully executing profitable growth strategies for our insurance operations, similar to how we have managed past challenges.
Our financial strength provides us the ability to maintain a long-term view, keeping a steady approach that can benefit all stakeholders. We reported a net loss of $418 million for the quarter due to the recognition of a reduction in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio. Non-GAAP operating income of $114 million for the third quarter of 2022 was down $95 million from a year ago, including catastrophe losses that were $19 million higher on an after-tax basis. Our 103.9% third quarter property casualty combined ratio was 11.3 percentage points higher than the 92.6% for the third quarter of last year.
Inflationary pressures led to higher estimated ultimate losses and rising loss ratios on a current accident year basis, while we experienced another quarter of favorable development on prior accident years, it was less favorable than a year ago. We continue to respond with underwriting selection and pricing actions addition to prudent reserving for estimated ultimate losses. In addition to various premium rate increase filings with the states, underwriters have increased expectations to address current inflationary trends in areas such as risk selection criteria, pricing of policies and adjusting premium factors for changes in exposure. Commercial umbrella loss experience has been elevated in recent quarters, and it's challenging to determine relevant drivers given unusual business activity and general uncertainty as the pandemic waned.
For example, the third quarter of 2022 included three very large claims with estimated losses averaging $9 million each, while elevated losses during the second quarter were driven more by a higher frequency of smaller claims. We continue to carefully underwrite commercial umbrella risks and respond promptly to adequately reserve for emerging loss patterns which we expect will eventually lead to a return of profitability for our commercial umbrella business. Overall premium growth was strong and included average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty insurance segments. Cincinnati Insurance appointed agencies continued their outstanding production and our underwriters are focused on working to retain and grow profitable accounts while addressing areas where they judge pricing is not adequate segmenting opportunities on a policy-by-policy basis.
Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 14% for the third quarter of 2022. That included a 12% increase in third quarter renewal written premiums, including 11% each for our commercial lines and personal lines insurance segments. Higher renewal premiums included healthy increases for higher levels of insured exposures that are rising faster due to elevated inflation amounts. For example, our commercial property premium adjustments for rising costs of building materials, so far this year, are about double the level of last year.
In addition to exposure increases, our commercial lines Insurance segment continued to experience estimated average renewal price increases in the mid-single-digit percentage range, somewhat higher than the second quarter. Our excess and surplus lines insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range, also higher than the second quarter. Personal lines average renewal price increases remained in the low single-digit range with auto a little higher and homeowner a little lower than the second quarter. Personal auto insurance for the industry, including our book of business, generally needs higher premium rates to achieve profitability.
Our excess and surplus lines segment had a 93.9% combined ratio and continued healthy growth with the third quarter 2022 net written premiums increase of 16%. Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global each experienced significant catastrophe losses from Hurricane Ian that drove their underwriting loss for the quarter. We expect catastrophe losses of that magnitude from time to time. Our estimate as of September 30 was within our expectations of loss potential for events of Ian's magnitude based on our models.
Results of modeled effects estimating probable maximum losses are disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K. Cincinnati Re grew third quarter 2022 net written premiums by 51%, while Cincinnati Global grew 21%, each having what we believe are good prospects for future profitability. Our life insurance subsidiary continued to perform quite well. Along with growth in term life insurance earned premiums up 4%, it produced third quarter 2022 net income of $21 million and nearly tripled operating income of a year ago.
We continue to use the value creation ratio as our primary measure of long-term financial performance. VCR was negative 8.4% for the third quarter of 2022. Net income before investment gains or losses made a positive contribution, but was again offset by lower investment valuations during the quarter. Next, chief financial officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight several other points we consider important regarding our financial performance.
Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income growth continued at a rate of 8% for the third quarter of 2022 compared with the third quarter of last year. Dividend income rose 8% for the quarter. Net equity securities purchased during the first nine months of 2022 totaled $47 million.
Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the third quarter of 2022 were unfavorable in aggregate for both our stock and bond holdings. The overall net decrease was approximately $1.2 billion before tax effects, including an additional and $514 million of unrealized losses in our bond portfolio. At the end of the quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $3.5 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $4.5 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of just under $1.1 billion.
Most of the decrease was from lower accruals for profit sharing commissions for agencies. Next, I'll comment on loss reserves. We continue to use a consistent approach that targets net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business.
While we've recently reported significant unfavorable reserve development on prior accident years for our commercial casualty lines of business, the net $25 million for the first nine months of 2022 included $41 million for the commercial umbrella and net favorable amount of $16 million for other coverages included in commercial casualty. Moving on to briefly highlight our consistent approach to capital management, we again repurchased shares that include maintenance intended to offset shares issued through equity compensation plans. Importantly, we continue to believe we have plenty of financial flexibility and also believe that our financial strength remained in excellent shape. During the third quarter we repurchased just under 2.1 million shares at an average price per share of $98.50.
As usual, I'll conclude with a summary of third quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting decreased book value by $0.12. Life insurance operations increased book value $0.14.
Investment income, other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items added $0.42. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value per share by $2.58. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio decreased book value by $3.46 and we declared $0.69 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $6.29 per share during the third quarter to $60.1 per share.
Thanks, Mike. Our fundamentals are strong, and we have an excellent book of business curated from our agency's best accounts. We've clearly communicated across the organization, the steps we need to take to improve challenged areas of our business and our underwriters are focused and aligned to those goals. Our financial strength remains excellent and allows us to keep concentrating on our long-term strategies and objectives of remaining a steady insurance market and producing shareholder value far into the future.",26.0,Medium
CINF,2022,4,"Good day, and welcome to the Cincinnati Financial Corporation fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, investor relations officer. Please go ahead.
First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release.
Good morning and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. We see positive momentum in several areas and are bullish about our future prospects despite 2022 financial results that were somewhat below our expectations. Challenges during the year included elevated inflation and higher losses from natural catastrophe events for us and the property casualty industry, in addition to the market volatility affecting the valuation of investment portfolios. Our experience in managing adversity, coupled with the company's financial strength, allows us to maintain a long-term view and supports our confidence as we execute our plans.
fourth-quarter property casualty combined ratio was 10.7 percentage points higher than the 84.2% for the fourth quarter of last year, which was among the best combined ratios we've ever recorded. We think longer-term comparisons are also important. On a current-accident-year basis, excluding catastrophe losses, our 90.2% combined ratio compares favorably with each of the five years prior to 2020 and was 1.5 percentage points better than the average for that period with each accident year measured as of the respective year-end. On a calendar-year basis, our 2022 combined ratio experienced a larger negative impact from catastrophe losses than in 2021, as they increased 4.2 percentage points for the fourth quarter and 1.2 points for the year.
We recognize that weather and significant changes in industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends are some of the variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report. In recent quarters, we've noted that commercial umbrella loss experience has been elevated. Although still elevated in the fourth quarter, it was to a lesser degree than earlier in 2022. While recent profitability for our commercial umbrella business is not as strong as we previously estimated, after strengthening reserves during 2022, the average combined ratio for the years 2018 through 2022 were still good, below 85% on a calendar-year basis and below 90% on an accident-year basis, with development through year-end 2022.
That includes a 13% increase in fourth-quarter renewal written premiums, a significant portion from higher levels of insured exposure as we factor in elevated inflation. In addition to exposures increases, our commercial lines insurance segment continued to experience estimated average renewal price increases in the mid-single-digit percentage range, higher than the third quarter. Our excess and surplus lines insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range. Personal lines' average renewal price increases were at the high end of the low single-digit range with both auto and homeowner higher than in the third quarter.
The commercial lines segment grew both fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 net written premiums 9%. Its combined ratio for both the quarter and full-year 2022 was approximately 99%. That's above where we aim for and reflects elevated inflation effects and catastrophe losses that were higher than a year ago. For our personal lines segment, net written premium grew 16% for the quarter and 15% for the full-year 2022 as we continued our planned expansion of high-net-worth business produced by our agencies.
On January 1st of this year, we again renewed each of our primary property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. Our strong capital supports retaining additional risk and managing costs of rising reinsurance ceded premiums. For our per-risk treaties, terms and conditions for 2023 are fairly similar to 2022 other than premium rate increases that averaged approximately 13%. The primary objective of our property casualty treaty -- catastrophe treaty is to protect our balance sheet.
The treaty's main change this year is retaining a greater share of losses for layers of coverage than what was effect in -- for 2022, while adding $92 million of coverage in a new layer between $900 million and $1.1 billion. In 2023, we'll retain all of the first $200 million of losses and share -- and a share of the next $900 million for a catastrophe event, compared with 2022 when we retained the first $100 million in a share of the next $800 million. Should we experience a 2023 catastrophe event totaling $1.1 billion in losses, we'll retain $542 million, compared with $499 million in 2022 for an event of that magnitude. We expect 2023 ceded premiums for these treaties in total to be approximately $130 million, approximately $16 million, or 14% higher than the actual $114 million of ceded premiums for these treaties in 2022.
Our investment department continued to perform quite well, and Mike will provide some details. Investments is another area where we like to keep an eye on longer-term trends. For example, for the five years ended with 2022, our equity portfolio compound annual total shareholder return was 11.1%, 170 basis points better than the S&P 500 index. I conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance.
Net income, before investment gains or losses, contributed favorably to VCR, 2.1% for the fourth quarter and 5.2% for the full-year 2022. The contribution from valuation of our investment portfolio was mixed, 10.5% favorable for the quarter, but unfavorable by 19.4% for the year due to challenges for both the stock and bond markets. A positive VCR of 12.8 for the quarter improved our 2022 full-year VCR to -14.6%. Of that -- although that's below our expectations for a typical year, the 11.2% annual average over the past five years is within our annual average target range of 10% to 13%.
Bond interest income was up 11% in the fourth quarter. The pre-tax average yield of 4.16% for the fixed maturity portfolio was 17 basis points higher than a year ago. The average pre-tax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds continued to rise to 5.01% during full-year 2022. We continue to emphasize investing in fixed-maturity securities, with net purchases during the year totaling $788 million.
Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2022 were favorable in aggregate for both our stock and bond holdings. The overall net gain for the quarter was nearly $1.3 billion before tax effects, including an additional $230 million of unrealized gains in our bond portfolio. At the end of 2022, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $4.7 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $5.5 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $847 million.
Our objective is to appropriately balance expense control with continuing to make strategic investments in our business. The full-year 2022 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.2 percentage points lower than last year, reflecting lower accruals for agency profit-sharing commissions. Regarding loss reserves, our approach remains consistent and target net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. We have now had $34 million of net favorable development on prior accident years.
As we do each quarter, we consider new information, such as paid losses and case reserves, in an updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. During 2022, our net increase in the property casualty loss and loss expense reserves was $1.029 billion, a 15% increase from the net reserve balance at year-end 2021. The IBNR portion of that reserve addition was $765 million, a further indication of the quality of our balance sheet. For full-year 2022, we experienced $159 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 2.3 percentage points.
Life insurance operations increased book value $0.10. Investment income, other than life insurance and net of non-insurance items, added $0.83. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed-income portfolio increased book value per share by $1.14. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $5.15.
Thanks, Mike. We faced a number of challenges in 2022 and still recorded an underwriting profit for our insurance business. That result bolsters our belief that we'll see future benefits from our efforts to continually refine pricing precision and segmentation, and our efforts to expand our geographic footprint and produce -- and product offerings. When you consider our financial strength, our experienced, service-oriented associates and our premier agency force, I'm confident we'll be able to continue delivering shareholder value far into the future.
Our board of directors shares that confidence and expressed it by increasing our quarterly cash dividend 9% last month, setting the stage for a 63rd year of rising dividend payments. So, that's not just paying the dividend for 63 straight years; that sets the stage for increasing the dividend for a 63rd consecutive year. We believe that's a record that can only be matched by seven other publicly traded U.S. companies.",26.0,Medium
COO,2022,1,"Thank you for standing by, and welcome to The Cooper Companies first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Kim Duncan, vice president, investor relations and risk management.
All of this is driven by our multifaceted commercial strategy that we began deploying years ago, which has proven to be extremely successful. This includes a consistent cadence of launching new products and product extensions around the world, providing customers with market-leading flexibility through our customized solutions, executing on key account relationships and delivering fantastic customer service. We're continuing these efforts while also enhancing our business through sales force expansions and targeted marketing and infrastructure investments. Regarding products, our daily silicone hydrogel lenses, MyDay, and clariti, posted strong results, growing 25%.
We've seen nice growth with this brand, especially in our Asia Pac region, where we just posted an extremely strong quarter. For our FRPs, we reported another solid quarter of 10% growth for Avaira and Biofinity, our silicone hydrogel two-week and monthly lenses. This was led by improved product availability and our unique offerings such as Biofinity toric multifocal and Energys, the most innovative product in the monthly space. To finish on products, we're continuing to see nice strength in torics and multifocals as we expand parameter ranges and increase availability around the world.
When you combine this with the success we're having in key accounts, it's resulting in nice share gains, and we expect that to continue. Moving to myopia management. We posted revenues of $20 million. And within this, MiSight grew 172%.
Within Canada, we've launched the product under the MiSight name, which is an exciting step in combining our myopia management glasses and contact lenses under one brand name. We've also accelerated activity in China and plan to launch the product later this fiscal year. To conclude on myopia management, our momentum is strong, and we're still targeting roughly $100 million in sales for this fiscal year. To wrap up on CooperVision, for calendar Q4, we estimate the global contact lens market grew 10%, with CooperVision growing 16%.
Meanwhile, long-term macro growth trends remain intact with roughly one-third of the world being myopic today and that's expected to increase to 50% by 2050. For CooperVision, we have a robust product portfolio, ongoing product launches, a fast-growing myopia management business and our fit data remains strong. So we remain very bullish on our business. Moving to CooperSurgical.
Strength was seen on a global basis and throughout our product portfolio, including from consumables, capital equipment and genomics. Within our office and surgical unit, we posted sales of $129 million, up 24% as reported, but down 3% when excluding Generate and other acquisitions. This was due to the negative impact of COVID on sales of PARAGARD, as well as certain surgical products. Having said that, we did see growth in many areas such as our laparoscopic surgery closure products, and our acquired businesses grew nicely, especially Fetal Pillow in our labor and delivery area, which grew 160%.
CooperVision posted a great quarter, and we're well positioned to continue delivering success with the best team in the industry and the broadest product portfolio in the market. Our fertility business is growing nicely and taking share, and the Generate business is integrating really well with some exciting potential as we incorporate stem cell storage into our labor and delivery product portfolio. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.
Free cash flow was solid at $109 million, comprised of $166 million of operating cash flow, offset by $57 million of capex. Net debt decreased by $1.6 billion to $3 billion, driven by the acquisition of Generate. And our adjusted leverage ratio increased to 2.71 times. During the quarter, we repurchased roughly 191,200 shares of the company's common stock for $78.5 million at an average purchase price of $410.41 per share, that's $410.41.
Roughly $256 million remains authorized for repurchase under our program. Moving to guidance. We've updated our numbers to reflect our outperformance in Q1, the addition of Generate, new currency rates and the assumption of a 25-basis-point rate increase by the Fed next week. Prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, this would have meant the midpoint for EPS would have been roughly $14.35, but currency has moved significantly against us over the past week.
We're increasing prices to offset the negative impact, and hopefully, the currency moves are temporary, but we're taking a conservative approach and fully incorporating negative currency into our guidance, noting that the scope, degree and duration of the crisis on the global economy is an evolving risk. With this, the new consolidated revenue range is $3.261 billion to $3.329 billion, up 6.5% to 8.5% organically. Within this, CooperVision revenue guidance is $2.221 billion to $2.264 billion, up 7% to 9% organically. CooperSurgical revenues are expected to be between $1.04 billion and $1.065 billion, up 35% to 38% as reported or 5% to 7% organically.
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $13.70 to $14.20. We estimate interest expense around $42 million, which assumes a 25-basis-point rate increase, remembering that $1 billion of our debt is fixed -- is at fixed rates. We estimate the full year tax rate to be around 14%. Regarding currency, on a year-over-year basis, the negative FX headwind is now roughly 3.5% to revenues and roughly 10% negative impact to EPS.
From a financial perspective, this business had roughly $158 million in sales in calendar 2021, and we expect long-term growth in the range of 5% to 9%. Additionally, we expect year one non-GAAP EPS accretion of roughly $0.60. For more information, please visit our IR website, where there is a presentation. In summary, we're pleased with this quarter's performance and believe our momentum will continue, driven by strategic investments in both businesses that will support share gains and durable long-term revenue and earnings growth.",20.0,Low
COO,2022,2,"Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to The Cooper Companies second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kim Duncan, vice president of investor relations and risk management.
Great. Thank you, Kim, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter conference call. Let me start by highlighting that our businesses are performing extremely well. Both CooperVision and CooperSurgical posted strong revenue growth, gained share and are continuing to see strong momentum.
We're successfully managing through a variety of challenges from supply chain to COVID restrictions in China and we're maintaining our market-leading growth rates. So I'm really pleased with how the year is progressing. For the full year, we're increasing our organic revenue guidance for both businesses by incorporating our Q2 outperformance and the strength we're continuing to see. Moving to the quarter.
So strong numbers, and we remain well-positioned to continue gaining share as we launch new products, expand product ranges, provide market-leading flexibility through our customized offerings, execute on key account relationships and deliver fantastic customer service. Regarding products, our daily silicone hydrogel lenses posted very strong results, growing 28%. Daily silicones continue to lead the market, and we offer the broadest portfolio in the industry. Our premium one-day offering, MyDay, is available on a broad range of spheres, torics and multifocals.
The other brand in our daily silicone hydrogel portfolio is clariti, which is also available as a sphere, toric and multifocal and is typically sold into more of a mass market setting. This lens performed really well again this quarter, especially in our Asia Pac region, where we're continuing to roll out this year in Japan. Our silicone FRPs, Biofinity and Avaira reported another solid quarter of 8% growth. And lastly, as an umbrella comment about all these offerings, I'm happy to report that we're seeing an uptick in the growth rate of our branded product sales.
Recent supply challenges have hit this operation hard, and we've experienced a significant decline in sales. Given this, we completed a strategic review and confirmed this is a nonstrategic business in a declining industry that's going to require a lot of capital to upgrade the facility. So we decided to exit the business by fiscal year-end. From a financial perspective, we expect this business to report roughly $20 million in revenues this year, down from $44 million last year.
Growth is also supported by the macro trends around vision correction, including that roughly a third of the world is myopic today and that is expected to increase to 50% by 2050. For CooperVision, we have a robust product portfolio, ongoing product launches, a fast-growing myopia management business, and our fit data remains very strong. So we remain very bullish on our future. Moving to CooperSurgical.
We posted sales of $162 million, down 1%. Our OB/GYN medical devices grew 3%, which was strong given this is the area where we were most impacted by global supply chain challenges. Particular strength in this business unit was seen within our labor and delivery portfolio and laparoscopic closure products. Moving to our stem cell storage business that we entered with the Generate acquisition, sales grew 5%.
There is a ton of activity right now integrating this business into CooperSurgical, and it's going well. The teams are seeing early success on commercial synergies, and they have some exciting ideas to drive additional growth synergies. So I remain bullish on our future in this space. Lastly, on PARAGARD.
We'll remain sensitive to the challenges facing us and be proactive managing our businesses, maintaining a focus on delivering long-term shareholder value. This includes continuing to make progress on our ESG initiatives. We just released our second ESG report, which highlights progress in several important areas, and you can find this report on our Investor Relations page. And lastly, I'd be remiss if I didn't thank our fantastic employees.
Operating expenses grew 18% and were 42.2% of revenues, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Generate Life Sciences and higher R&D investments. Consolidated operating margin was 24.5%. Within this, we did see challenges from supply chain and inflationary pressures, but our teams did a nice job managing costs and price increases and continuing efficiency improvement initiatives, such as the consolidation of CooperSurgical's production into Costa Rica helped offset the impact. Interest expense was $10.8 million, and our effective tax rate was 13.7%.
Non-GAAP EPS was $3.24, with roughly 49.7 million average shares outstanding. Year-over-year FX negatively impacted earnings by $0.53 in the quarter, which was $0.15 worse than we forecasted at the time of our last earnings call. One point to mention is that a large portion of the quarterly FX loss was from the remeasurement impact of yen and euro-based intercompany trade receivables. These remeasurements happen every quarter, and the net amount is usually relatively small.
However, significant currency moves toward the end of the quarter resulted in a larger loss in other income and expense. The other unusual item from this quarter was the operating loss from our contact lens solutions business of roughly $0.05. To add some color to what Al mentioned earlier, this has not been a profitable business for us this year. We had a recall in Q1, which resulted in low sales and an operating loss.
We expected the business to rebound in Q2, but continuing supply chain challenges prevented that. And Q2 sales were only $4.4 million with a roughly $2.7 million operating loss. From a non-GAAP perspective, we recognized and excluded many costs from the shutdown decision this quarter. But the business remains operational, so activity remains in our non-GAAP P&L and will remain so until we exit the business at fiscal year-end.
Returning to the quarter. Free cash flow was $88 million. Net debt decreased $125 million to $2.86 billion and our adjusted leverage ratio reduced to 2.59 times. Net debt decreased by more than free cash flow due to the positive impact from closing the SightGlass Vision joint venture.
Moving to guidance. We're increasing our revenue growth ranges for CooperVision and CooperSurgical to include our Q2 results and the strength we're continuing to see in our markets, offset mostly by the impact of currency. For EPS, we're updating our guidance to reflect the negative impact of currency and interest rates but holding it unchanged outside of that. Outside of that, there are a number of moving parts, but ultimately positives such as higher revenues, efficiency efforts, and a lower effective tax rate are offsetting supply chain inflationary pressures and the negative impact of the solutions shutdown.
Although we don't provide quarterly guidance with a number of moving parts, let me add that we expect Q3 earnings to be similar to Q2 driven by the significant negative impact of currency for the quarter. We also forecast a large increase in interest expense in Q3, but expect that to be offset by a lower tax rate. For Q4, we expect a rebound in EPS, led by a lower pound flowing through our cost of goods, helping CooperVision's gross margin. And note, this guidance does not include our pending acquisition of Cook Medical's reproductive health business.",20.0,Low
COO,2022,3,"Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Cooper Company's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker Kim Duncan, vice president, investor relations and risk management. You may begin.
Thank you, Kim, and welcome, everyone, to Cooper Company's third quarter conference call. Let me start by highlighting that this was the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth for CooperVision and the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue for CooperSurgical's fertility business. This impressive performance showcases the strength of our teams and the strong demand for our products and services. This momentum continued in August, and we're increasing the organic revenue guidance for both CooperVision and CooperSurgical, incorporating our strong Q3 and the strength we're continuing to see.
Overall, the challenging macro environment, including headwinds from currency, inflation and supply chain challenges has negatively impacted profitability, but has not reduced our ability to take share and drive sustainable top line growth. Moving to the third quarter results. Consolidated revenues reached an all-time high of $843 million, with CooperVision posting record revenues of $566 million, up 11% organically and CooperSurgical posting record revenues of $277 million, up 35% as reported, up 3% organically. Growth was led by our Daily Silicone hydrogel portfolio and myopia management products for CooperVision and fertility for CooperSurgical.
Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.19 and we posted record quarterly free cash flow of $217 million. For CooperVision and reporting all percentages on an organic basis, revenue growth was strong and diversified in all product categories, spheres, torics and multifocals and within all three geographic regions. The Americas was up 7%, EMEA grew 15% and Asia Pac grew 11%. This performance was driven by a number of factors, including new product launches, expanded product ranges market-leading flexibility through our customized offerings, growth in key accounts and strength of branded products.
Regarding product details, daily silicone hydrogel lenses grew 24%, led by great results from both MyDay and clariti. Daily silicones continue to be the main driver of growth for the contact lens industry, and we offer the broadest portfolio in the market with MyDay and clariti available on a broad range of spheres, torics and multifocals. Within this, we're continuing to see especially strong growth from MyDay, including from the very successful rollout of the MyDay multifocal which is taking share in markets around the world. The feedback from patients remains fantastic, and optometrists continue reporting that our breakthrough binocular progressive fitting system is allowing them to fit the lens quickly and accurately.
This success is driving a positive halo effect on MyDay spheres and torics, and we remain very optimistic about the future of this brand. Clariti also posted a solid quarter with particular strength noted in Asia Pac. And our silicone hydrogel FRP lenses, Biofinity and Avaira, reported another solid quarter of 8% growth. Regarding product launches, we remain very active.
I'm excited to announce, we'll be seeding the market with MyDay Energys over the next several months with a full launch scheduled for early calendar 2023. We've had a lot of requests for the Energys technology in a daily lens and given the success we've had with Biofinity Energys. We're really excited about this opportunity. MyDay Energys will use the same digital zone optics technology as Biofinity Energys providing wearers greater comfort when using digital devices, along with enhanced end-of-day comfort.
This daily lens is a perfect product for today's digital world and another great example of CooperVision leading with innovation and manufacturing know-how. And building on this, we'll also be launching an expanded MyDay toric parameter range in early fiscal 2023. MyDay already offers the most prescription options in the daily toric market, and this expansion will essentially match the leading offerings in the FRP toric segment, which will be a first for the contact lens industry. All this activity supports a fantastic MyDay brand and exemplifies CooperVision's focus on offering practitioners a wide variety of market-leading technologically superior products.
Moving to myopia management. Another exciting area where we're a market leader. We posted revenues of $24 million, up 42%, including MiSight up 109%. Our growth trajectory remains strong with the main challenge being in China, where all contact lens sales, including MiSight and Ortho-K products have experienced difficulties due to ongoing COVID restrictions.
This starts with a large macro growth trend that roughly one-third of the world is myopic today, and that is expected to increase to 50% by 2050. This is driving heightened screen time, among other factors. Additionally, the shift to silicone hydrogel dailies remains strong, the penetration of higher-value products such as torics and multifocals is growing. The number of wearers is growing, and we're seeing price increases.
We expect global growth to remain healthy and believe we'll remain a leader with our robust product portfolio, ongoing product launches, fast-growing myopia management business and leading New Fit data. And speaking of data, I'm proud to say Counter Q2 U.S. stats showed CooperVision was the  No. 1 company for new wearers and the only manufacturer to grow share in all three daily categories, spheres, torics and multifocals.
Moving to office and surgical products, which includes OB/GYN medical devices, PARAGARD and stem cell storage. We posted sales of $165 million, up 36%, but down 3% organically. OB/GYN medical device sales were negatively impacted by heightened back orders due to supply chain challenges. We've seen good demand and positive signs in our supply chain to start this quarter, so we expect healthy growth in fiscal Q4.
The other parts of the business are making progress, and the integration activity is going well. We expect a strong finish to this year and believe we're in an excellent position to deliver long-term mid-single-digit growth. To conclude, we operate in recession-resistant industries with strong macro growth trends but we're not immune to supply chain challenges and currency is having a material impact on our as-reported results. Having said that, our core business fundamentals are excellent.
We're taking market share. We're leveraging where we can, we're taking price. We'll remain extremely focused on the challenges facing us and will be proactive and we will proactively manage operations while maintaining a focus on delivering long-term shareholder value. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss financial results and guidance.
Operating expenses grew 13% and were 42.7% of revenues, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Generate Life Sciences. Consolidated operating margin was 23.4%, within these results, currency is having a significant impact -- negative impact along with supply chain and inflationary pressures. We raised prices to offset some of this and have additional price increases coming, and we'll continue to work diligently controlling costs. Moving below the line, interest expense significantly increased year over year to $17 million, with higher rates and debt balances driving a large year-over-year increase.
The effective tax rate was 10.2% and non-GAAP EPS was $3.19, with roughly 49.6 million average shares outstanding. Year-over-year FX negatively impacted earnings by $0.67 in the quarter, which was $0.10 worse than we forecasted at the time of our last earnings call. As with last quarter, a large part of the $0.10 was attributable to the remeasurement of foreign currency-based intercompany trade receivables, which are recognized in other income and expense. In order to reduce this variability moving forward, we've made moves, including closing out certain nonfunctional exposures and improving our natural and synthetic hedge positions.
Moving forward, we believe these efforts will do a better job mitigating the impact of FX gains or losses that occur below the operating income line. Returning to the quarter. Free cash flow was extremely strong at $217 million, and we decreased net debt by $218 million to $2.64 billion. This reduced leverage to 2.44 times, which lowered the borrowing rate on our long-term credit facility pricing grid by 25 basis points.
Specific to fiscal Q4, the consolidated revenue guidance range is $830 million to $850 million, up 9% to 11% organically, with CooperVision revenues of $554 million to $565 million, up 8% to 10% organically, and CooperSurgical revenues of $276 million to $285 million, up 10% to 15% organically. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.05 to $3.20 based on a roughly 13.5% effective tax rate and roughly $22 million of interest expense, which includes an assumption for a 75 basis point increase in September. Regarding currency, we're now forecasting the year-over-year negative impact in Q4 to be roughly 8% headwind to revenues and a 20% headwind to EPS. For fiscal 2023, we won't be providing detailed guidance, but let me provide some high-level direction.
Assuming currency rates remain similar to where they are today, interest expense increases to around $85 million due to multiple rate hikes. Our effective tax rate increases to roughly 15%, and the macroeconomic environment remains challenging. We expect to report low single-digit year-over-year non-GAAP EPS growth. These expectations do not include the pending acquisition of Cook Medical's reproductive health business.",20.0,Low
COP,2022,1,"[Audio gap] During the call, we'll make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Of course, actual results may differ due to the factors described in today's release and our periodic SEC filings. And finally, we'll also make reference to some non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in this morning's release and on our website.
Thank you, Mark. Before we get into the results for the quarter, I'd like to touch on a couple of other items that are top of mind for us. The first is the war in Ukraine. In a world already ravaged by the pandemic, this unprovoked invasion is having tragic consequences as we all see in heartbreaking detail in the news every day.
The bravery of the Ukrainian people is inspiring, and we pray for a peaceful resolution at the earliest possible moment. This deeply troubling war is also disrupting supply chains at a time of recovering global economic growth and energy demand. It is affecting every aspect of the global economy and impacting the energy security of our allies in Europe, and it's driving significant volatility in commodity prices. We are fortunate that the United States has abundant resources to ensure our own energy security.
These resources also provide vital geopolitical benefits. Secure U.S. energy exports serve as a market stabilizing factor, enabling our allies to better withstand energy blackmail by hostile and unreliable resources. Like the rest of industry, we've quickly restored activity levels from the lows driven by the pandemic-related energy price collapse despite lingering service and supply chain shortages, infrastructure permitting delays and lag time required for workforce and equipment redeployment.
As a result, total U.S. oil and gas production is growing meaningfully despite these headwinds. And ConocoPhillips will continue to do our part as we fulfill our triple mandate of reliably and responsibly meeting energy transition demand, delivering competitive returns on and of capital and achieving our net zero ambition. Now the other topic I'd like to touch on are the leadership changes we announced a couple of days ago.
I suspect you all saw the release on Monday, but for those who might have missed it, Tim will be transitioning from leading our Lower 48 business, which he's done incredibly well since we combined companies a little over a year ago, to serving in an advisory role to myself and the entire leadership team. Tim has truly been an industry visionary founding Concho almost 20 years ago, and growing it into one of the Permian's largest and best run companies before joining ConocoPhillips. He's also been instrumental in driving value realization as we've integrated the assets into the company. I'm appreciative that we'll continue to benefit from Tim's significant experience and strategic relationships in his new capacity and of course, as a member of our board.
I'm also very pleased to welcome Jack Harper, who most of you know, to our leadership team as executive vice president of our Lower 48 business. Jack is an experienced proven leader who will help ensure that our Lower 48 business fulfills its key role in delivering on our triple mandate. Reflecting now in the quarter. Once again, we've made significant progress working on all levers across the company.
We efficiently and safely delivered our capital scope globally and successfully integrated the Shell Permian assets. We also took important steps to further strengthen our balance sheet and continue to upgrade our portfolio, with the sale of our mature Indonesian business and the acquisition of an additional 10% stake in our long-life, high-quality APLNG business. We're running well and with very strong financial performance. Now building on two very successful Permian transactions, we have truly transformed ConocoPhillips.
That's driven by strong realized prices and production of 1,747,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a record level of production since we became an independent E&P 10 years ago and is bolstered by our two highly accretive Permian acquisitions over the past 18 months. Lower 48 production averaged 967,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter, including 640,000 from the Permian, 208,000 from Eagle Ford and 97,000 from the Bakken. Operations across the rest of our global portfolio also ran well, allowing us to generate $7 billion in cash from operations, excluding working capital in the quarter. We also continue to enhance our low cost of supply, low greenhouse gas intensity portfolio, closing on both the sale of our Indonesian assets and the acquisition of an additional 10% of APLNG, taking ownership there to 47.5%.
Both of these transactions enhance our overall margins going forward. Illustrating this point, we realized roughly $500 million in cash distributions from APLNG in the first quarter, and we've already received $400 million so far in the second quarter. While the full-year distributions will continue to depend on prices going forward, if you assume Brent averages $100 per barrel for the year, we would expect roughly $2.3 billion of total distributions from APLNG in 2022. Turning back to focus on the first quarter.
Also in April, we called our $1.3 billion note, which was due in 2026. So we'll have achieved approximately half of our $5 billion debt reduction target by the end of May. And with the progress we've made in the first two quarters of this year and our remaining natural maturities, we'll reduce our debt by $3.3 billion this year. We are now positioned to meet our overall $5 billion reduction target in 2025.
That's one year earlier than our prior projections. As you will have noted, we also invested roughly $1.8 billion back into the business in the first quarter of the year. While this is ratable with the $7.2 billion full year capital estimate we provided last December, we're increasing our guidance to $7.8 billion. About half of the increase is due to additional low cost of supply drilling and completion activity in some of our partner-operated areas in the Lower 48.
And the rest is modestly higher inflation, as we believe such supply chain constraints will be prolonged as a result of the ongoing conflict in the Ukraine. From a reduction standpoint, we've adjusted our full year target from an approximate 1.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day to roughly 1.76 million per day. That's reflecting the net impact of closed A&D activity through this point in the year as well as some expected impacts from weather and well timing. So we've had a strong quarter to open the year.",35.0,High
COP,2022,2,"Welcome to the Q2 2022 ConocoPhillips earnings conference call. My name is Richard, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mark Keener, vice president, investor relations. Mr.
And finally, we'll make reference to some non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in this morning's release and on our website. With that, I'll turn it over to Ryan. 
Now before I get into the results for the quarter, I'd also like to touch on a few things that continue to be top of mind for us. The ongoing tragic invasion in Ukraine and the residual implications from COVID have significantly impacted supply chains around the world, with shock waves driving both product shortages and elevated levels of volatility, including large swings in commodity prices. The combination of these factors has brought into sharp focus their critical importance of U.S. and global energy security and reliability.
By fulfilling our triple mandate of responsibly and reliably meeting energy transition pathway demand, delivering competitive returns on and of capital and progressing toward achieving our net zero operational emissions ambition, we're playing a key role in providing secure, dependable energy solutions that are clearly needed around the globe. The guiding principles of our triple mandate were key to our recent actions and announcements regarding global LNG supply capacity, as the use of natural gas in place of coal and refining products represents an opportunity for significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions around the world. We believe this reality is going to drive increasingly strong global LNG demand and related opportunities well into the future. As recently announced, we entered into an HOA with Sempra for a possible investment in the Port Arthur LNG project that's currently underway.
The potential investment is designed to leverage our company's considerable strength as one of the largest gas producers and marketers in North America, while expanding our global LNG business. This potential investment is expected to be project financed and, if executed, would afford us the opportunity to participate in additional strategically located LNG projects, as well as to jointly pursue related emissions reduction opportunities. That announcement followed our recently completed 10% ownership increase in APLNG, as well as our selection to participate in Qatar's North Field East project, adding to our long positive relationship with QatarEnergy. Our recent decision to join the OGMP 2.0 initiative is also in service to achieving our triple mandate, as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including methane is an imperative for our company and our sector.
Operations across the rest of our global portfolio also ran well, leading us to generate $7.8 billion in cash from operations in the quarter, excluding working capital. This includes roughly $750 million in distributions from APLNG, and we continue to project full year distributions of $2.3 billion, with roughly $300 million expected in the third quarter. We also invested $2 billion back into the business in the second quarter, resulting in free cash flow of $5.9 billion. That more than covered the total $3.3 billion we returned to shareholders in the quarter, as well as the $1.9 billion used to reduce total debt.
Now in conjunction with these changes, we reduced DD&A guidance from $7.7 billion to $7.6 billion for the year. We also increased full year 2022 adjusted operating cost guidance to $7.5 billion from the prior $7.3 billion. Now this is reflecting commodity-related price impacts. We reduced guidance for the corporate segment loss from $1 billion to $900 million, primarily due to lower interest expense resulting from our recent debt reduction and higher interest earned on cash balances, along with some restructuring efforts.",35.0,High
COP,2022,3,"Welcome to the Q3 2022 ConocoPhillips earnings conference call. My name is Richard, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator instructions] I will now turn the call over to Phil Gresh, vice president, investor relations. Sir, you may begin.
Yes. Thank you, Richard. And welcome to everyone joining us for our third quarter earnings conference call. On the call today are several members of the ConocoPhillips leadership team, including Ryan Lance, chairman and CEO; Bill Bullock, executive vice president and chief financial officer; Dominic Macklon, executive vice president of strategy, sustainability, and technology; Nick Olds, executive vice president of global operations; Jack Harper, executive vice president of Lower 48; and Tim Leach, advisor to the CEO.
Second, during this call, we'll be making forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results may differ due to factors noted in today's release and in our periodic SEC filings. Finally, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in today's release and on our website.
Thank you, Phil. Before we get into our strong results for the quarter, including record production, I'd like to touch on a few big-picture thoughts that are top of mind for us. First, inflation and supply chain constraints continue across the entire economy and our industry. This is particularly true in the U.S.
shale, where rapidly escalating costs, combined with extremely tight supply, are limiting the pace of industrywide production growth. Second, we believe that the world is going to need investments in medium- and long-cycle production, in addition to U.S. shale plays. The depth and quality of our U.S.
unconventional inventory, combined with our diverse global portfolio, has us well-positioned to meet these long-term supply challenges. And finally, a successful energy transition must meet society's fundamental need for a secure, reliable, and affordable energy while progressing to a lower carbon future. This requires an all-of-the-above solution. Obstacles that prevent the global market from functioning properly are not going to help the American consumer and would be disastrous for our allies.
And third, we continue to progress our Port Arthur LNG project with Sempra, which we expect to reach FID by early next year. Overall, we continue to believe the substitution of natural gas in place of coal represents an opportunity for significant reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions. This should drive global LNG demand and related opportunities well into the future. Putting this all together, we remain constructive on the outlook for the industry.
And we have a deep portfolio of short, medium and longer cycle, low cost to supply assets that generate strong cash flow as we continue to deliver on our triple mandate. Now, let me turn the call over to Bill to cover our overall performance for the quarter.
Now, this included a $15 billion benefit from working capital, primarily due to the timing of Norway tax payments and lower receivables. Excluding working capital, cash from operations was $7.2 billion. AP LNG distributions were 257 million in the quarter. And we expect fourth quarter distributions to be about $600 million.
And I could not feel better about how this has played out. This may be one of the most dynamic times that we've ever seen in the industry. And my competitive side certainly makes me wish that I could stay on board for what is ahead. However, I'm confident that we have set up the team for success with our organizational structure and planned transition over the next few months.",35.0,High
COP,2022,4,"Welcome to the Q4 2022 ConocoPhillips earnings conference call. My name is Michelle, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator instructions] I will now turn the call over to Phil Gresh. vice president, investor relations.
After which, the team will be available for your questions. A few quick reminders. First, along with today's release, we published supplemental financial materials and a presentation, which you can find on our investor relations website. Second, during this call, we'll be making forward-looking statements based on current expectations.
Actual results may differ due to factors noted in today's release and in our periodic SEC filings. Finally, to make, we will make reference to some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in today's release and on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ryan. 
This can be done by enacting policies that encourage the development of lower emission energy sources and oil and gas resources. These policies should include efforts aimed at fiscal stability, streamlining of the permitting process, increased transparency on timelines, and supporting critical infrastructure. These are not just necessary for the oil and gas industry, but also for nuclear, hydrogen, and renewables, all of which will be necessary to deliver on the energy transition. At the end of the day, it's critical for our administration to remember that North American energy production is a stabilizing force for both global energy security and meeting energy transition demand.
Meeting that demand will require investments in medium- and long-cycle projects in addition to short-cycle U.S. shale. This is why you see ConocoPhillips leaning a bit further across our deep and diversified portfolio in 2023. Whether it's the Lower 48, where we achieved record production in 2022, or our diversified global portfolio, ConocoPhillips is well positioned to meet the world's long-term energy needs, while also reducing our own emissions footprint.
This is further evidenced by our organic reserve replacement ratio of 177% in 2022. We're also enthusiastic about our new LNG opportunities we are participating in, in Qatar and the United States, which are highly complementary to our existing LNG business. And we look forward to providing you a comprehensive update about our long-term strategy and our financial outlook at our up and coming analyst and investor meeting on April 12 at the New York Stock Exchange. Now, let me turn the call over to Bill to cover our fourth quarter performance and 2023 guidance in a bit more detail.
Moving to cash flow. Fourth quarter CFO was $6.5 billion, excluding working capital, at an average WTI price of $83 per barrel. AP LNG distributions were $639 million. And fourth quarter capital expenditures were 2.5 billion, including 2.1 billion of base capital and 300 million for acquisitions and North Field East payments.
On capital allocation, we returned $5.1 billion to shareholders through ordinary dividends, VROC payments, and share buybacks, while also reducing gross debt by $400 million. Full year CFO was 28.5 billion, excluding working capital, at an average WTI price of $94 per barrel on 2022. Full year AP LNG distributions were $2.2 billion. And full year total capex was 10.2 billion, with base capex achieving our guidance of $8.1 billion, and 2.1 billion of acquisitions and North Field East payments.
Our full year plan maintenance is expected to be similar to 2022. On capital spending, we expect a range of 10.7 to 11.3 billion, which I would discuss in more detail in a moment. We expect operating costs of 8.2 billion, DD&A of 8.1 billion, and corporate segment net loss of 900 million. For 2023 cash flow, we forecast $22 billion in CFO and $80 barrel, WTI; 85, Brent; and 3.25, Henry Hub at current strip prices for regional differentials.",35.0,High
CVX,2022,1,"Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's first quarter 2022 earnings conference call and webcast. I'm Roderick Green, GM of investor relations. Our chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me.
The last two years have been volatile and unpredictable, driven by the global pandemic and geopolitical conflict, creating strains on economies and markets around the world. Through it all, our objectives have been clear and consistent. And in the first quarter, we continued to make progress, delivering book returns in the mid-teens, investing to grow both our traditional and new energy businesses and returning even more cash to shareholders while maintaining an industry-leading balance sheet. Recent events remind us of the importance of energy.
Looking forward, I know that Chevron is doing its part, raising this year's Permian production outlook and advancing two important renewable fuel transactions: our Bunge JV, which is expected to close shortly; and the Renewable Energy Group acquisition, which is expected to close around midyear. While the future is uncertain, our actions are not. We're on a path to delivering higher returns and lower carbon and rewarding our stakeholders all along the way. With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre to discuss our financials.
Thanks, Mike. We reported first quarter earnings of $6.3 billion or $3.22 per share. Adjusted earnings were $6.5 billion or $3.36 per share. Included in the current quarter were pension settlement costs totaling $66 million and negative foreign currency effects exceeding $200 million.
This quarter's proceeds from option exercises were over 4x the historical annual average of around $1 billion per year. About two-thirds of the vest adoptions at year-end 2021 were exercised during the first quarter, lowering the potential future rate of dilution from the outstanding balance. Over time, we expect our share buybacks to more than offset the first quarter dilutive effect. Adjusted first quarter earnings were up $4.8 billion versus last quarter -- versus last year.
Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily on timing effects. The all other segment was down primarily on unfavorable tax items and higher corporate charges. The all other segment results can vary between quarters, and our full year guidance is unchanged. First quarter oil equivalent production decreased 2% year on year due to the expiration of Rokan in Indonesia, lower production in Thailand as we approach the end of the concession and lower entitlements due to higher prices.
Permian growth in the absence of Winter Storm Uri, impacts partially offset and drove U.S. oil and gas production up over 10%. Now, looking ahead. In the second quarter, we expect lower production due to planned turnarounds at Wheatstone and Angola LNG, impacts from CPC pipeline and the expiration of the Area 1 concession in Thailand.
At CPC, two of the three single port moorings are now back in service and TCO has returned to full operations. Downtime associated with the April repairs is estimated to be less than 15% of our second quarter turnaround and downtime guidance. We anticipate a return of capital between $250 million and $350 million from Angola LNG in the second quarter. This cash is reported through cash from investing and not cash from operations.
In the first quarter, Angola LNG returned over $500 million of capital. The differences between affiliate earnings and dividends are not ratable and TCO has not yet declared a dividend in 2022. With higher commodity prices, affiliate dividends are expected to be $1 billion higher than our previous guidance. We've utilized our NOLs and other U.S.
tax attributes and expect to make estimated U.S. federal and state income tax payments in the second quarter. These payments will flow through working capital accounts, just like our first quarter IRS refunded. In the second quarter, we expect to invest $600 million as we close the Bunge joint venture and to repurchase shares at the top of our guidance range.",38.0,High
CVX,2022,2,"With the acquisition of REG, our total investment was $6.8 billion, more than double last year's quarter. Strong cash flow enabled us to fund this higher level of investment, pay down debt for the fifth consecutive quarter, and returned more than $5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Adjusted second quarter earnings were up more than $8 billion versus last year. Adjusted upstream earnings increased mainly on higher realizations partially offset by lower liftings from the end of concessions and Indonesia and Thailand.
Adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily on higher refining margins. Compared with last quarter, adjusted earnings were up nearly $5 billion. Adjusted upstream earnings increased primarily on higher realizations, partially offset by tax and other items, including higher withholding taxes on TCO dividends and cash repatriations. Adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily on higher refining margins and a favorable swing in timing effects.
Our development costs are down about 25% since 2019, and we expect to keep them flat this year by offsetting inflation with productivity improvements. An example of simul frac, where we performed completion activities on four wells at a time, reducing cycle time by a quarter. We continue to design, construct and operate facilities to limit methane emissions. Two of our Midland Basin sites recently earned the highest ratings from Project Canary's independent certification program.
WPMP start-up is expected in the second half of next year and FGP's expected timing remains first half of 2024. TCO's operations continue to generate strong cash flow, enabling a midyear dividend with project spend decreasing, we're expecting higher dividends going forward. In Australia, we shipped 87 LNG cargoes from Gorgon and Wheatstone in the first half of this year, up over 10% from last year. Our reliability benchmarks in the first quartile and we intend to stay there with an ongoing focus on operational excellence.
Gulf Coast with 1.5 million tons a year expected to start in 2026. These agreements leverage our growing U.S. natural gas production and expand our value chains in Atlantic Basin markets. Now back to you, Pierre.
In May, we launched our joint venture with Bunge. The JV is operating two existing crushers, and evaluation work is underway to expand crush capacity and add pretreatment facilities. In carbon capture and storage, we closed on the expanded JV to develop the Bayou Bend CCS hub. The lease held by the JV is in Texas State Waters near large industrial emitters, and we believe it is the first U.S.
offshore lease dedicated to CCS. Also, we recently filed for a conditional use permit in Kern County, California, to store CO2 emissions from one of our cogeneration plants. Now looking ahead. In the third quarter, we expect turnarounds and downtime to reduce production in a number of locations.
In downstream, planned turnarounds are primarily at our California refineries. We do not expect significant dividends from TCO or Angola LNG until the fourth quarter. Our full year guidance for affiliate dividends is unchanged, with upside potential beyond the top of the range depending on commodity prices. Also, we increased the top end of our share buyback guidance range to $15 billion per year and expect to be at that rate during the third quarter.",38.0,High
CVX,2022,3,"Thank you, Sara. Welcome to Chevron's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call and webcast. I'm Roderick Green, GM of investor relations. Our chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me.
During the third quarter, we continued to make progress by delivering return on capital employed in the mid-20s, returning more than $5 billion to shareholders for the second quarter in a row and investing to grow both our traditional and new energy businesses. Earlier this week, we released our methane report with specific disclosures about our aim to be a leader in methane emissions management. Our goal is simple: keep methane in the pipe. I encourage you to read our report available on chevron.com.
Our strategy remains clear and consistent. Our results keep getting better. While future market conditions are uncertain, we're well-positioned to deliver value to our shareholders in any environment. With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre.
We repurchased shares at the high end of our guidance range and ended the quarter with a net debt ratio under 5%. Cash capex was $3 billion, up over 50% from last year. For the sixth consecutive quarter, Chevron's free cash flow exceeded $5 billion. We're on track to beat 2021's free cash flow record.
Adjusted third-quarter earnings were up more than $5 billion versus last year. Adjusted upstream earnings increased mainly on higher realizations partially offset by inventory timing impacts. In Other, tax benefits are more than offset by higher operating expenses and other costs. Adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily on higher refining margins and favorable inventory timing impacts.",38.0,High
DHI,2022,1,"Good morning and welcome to the first quarter 2022 earnings conference call for D.R. Horton, America's Builder, the largest builder in the United States. I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, vice president of investor relations for D.R. Horton.

Even with the recent rise in mortgage rates, housing market conditions remain very robust and we are focused on maximizing returns while continuing to increase our market share. There are still significant challenges in the supply chain, including shortages in certain building materials and a very tight labor market. We are focused on building the infrastructure and processes to support a higher level of home starts while working to stabilize and then reduce construction cycle times to our historical norms. After starting construction on 25,500 homes this quarter, our homes and inventory increased 30% from a year ago to 54,800 homes with only 1,000 unsold completed homes across the nation.
Our net sales orders in the first quarter increased 5% to 21,522 homes, while the value increased 29% from the prior year to $8.3 billion. A year ago, our first quarter net sales orders were up 56% due to the surge in housing demand during the first year of the pandemic when we had significantly more completed homes available to sale and prior to the significant supply chain challenges we've experienced since. Our average number of active selling communities decreased 3% from the prior-year quarter and was up 3% sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the first quarter was $383,600, up 22% from the prior-year quarter.
Our January home sales and net sales order volume were in line with our plans and we are well positioned to deliver double-digit volume growth in fiscal 2022 with 29,300 homes in backlog, 54,800 homes in inventory, a robust lot supply and strong trade and supplier relationships. Bill?
Our average cycle or average construction cycle time for homes closed in the first quarter has increased by almost two weeks since our fourth quarter and two months from a year ago. Although we have not seen much improvement in the supply chain yet, we are focused on working to stabilize and then reduce our construction cycle times to historical norms. Mike?
Horton or subject to a right of first offer based on executed purchase and sale agreements. $330,000 million of our finished lots purchased in the first quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had approximately $500 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt to capital ratio of 33.9%.
Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. During the three months ended December, our cash used in homebuilding operations was $115 million as we invested significant operating capital to increase our homes and inventory to meet the current strong demand. At December 31, we had $4.1 billion of homebuilding liquidity consisting of $2.1 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. We believe this level of homebuilding cash and liquidity is appropriate to support the scale and activity of our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions.
Our homebuilding leverage was 17.3% at the end of December and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 6.9%. Our consolidated leverage at December 31 was 25.1% and consolidated leverage net of cash was 15.2%. At December 31, our stockholders' equity was $15.7 billion and book value per share was $44.25, up 29% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended December, our return on equity was 32.4% compared to 24.4% a year ago.
During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $80.1 million and our board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in February. We repurchased 2.7 million shares of common stock for $278.2 million during the quarter. Our remaining share repurchase authorization at December 31 was $268 million. We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis and to reducing our outstanding share count each fiscal year.
As we look forward to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we are expecting market conditions to remain similar with strong demand from homebuyers, but continuing supply chain challenges. We expect to generate consolidated revenues in our March quarter of $7.3 billion to $7.7 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in a range between 19,000 and 20,000 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be approximately 27.5% and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the second quarter to be approximately 7.5%. We anticipate the financial services pre-tax profit margin in the range of 30% to 35% and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 24% in the second quarter.
For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect to close between 90,000 and 92,000 homes, while we now expect to generate consolidated revenues of $34.5 billion to $35.5 billion. We forecast an income tax rate for fiscal 2022 of approximately 24% and we also continue to expect that our share repurchases will reduce our outstanding share count by approximately 2% at the end of fiscal 2022 compared to the end of fiscal 2021. We still expect to generate positive cash flow from our homebuilding operations this year after our investments in home building inventories to support double-digit growth. We will then continue to balance our cash flow utilization priorities among increasing the investment in our rental operations, maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying an increased dividend and consistently repurchasing shares.",22.0,Medium

Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint. Housing market demand remained strong despite the recent increase in mortgage rates and we are focused on maximizing returns while continuing to aggregate market share. There are still significant challenges in the supply chain, including shortages in certain building materials and a very tight labor market. Our construction cycle times were extended further this quarter, and we continue to work on stabilizing and then reducing our cycle times to historical norms.

Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible, and opportunistic. At March 31st, we had $3.2 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $1.2 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage was 16.4% at the end of March, and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 11.2%. Our consolidated leverage at March 31st was 24.9% and consolidated leverage net of cash was 18.9%.
At March 31st, our stockholders' equity was $16.8 billion, and book value per share was $47.66, up 33% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended March, our return on equity was 34%, compared to 27.1% a year ago. During the first six months of the year, our cash used in homebuilding operations was $416 million, which reflects our increased homes and inventory to meet demand and the impact of extended construction cycle times. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $79.1 million, and our board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in May.
As we look forward to the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect market conditions to continue to reflect strong demand from homebuyers with continuing supply chain challenges. We expect to generate consolidated revenues in our June quarter of $8.6 billion to $9 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in a range between 21,500 and 22,500 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the third quarter to be in the range of 29% to 29.5% and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the third quarter to be around 6.6%. We anticipate a financial services pre-tax profit margin of approximately 40%, and we expect our income tax rate to be roughly 24% in the third quarter.
For the full fiscal year, we expect to generate consolidated revenues of $35.3 billion to $36.1 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in a range of 88,000 to 90,000 homes. We forecast an income tax rate for fiscal 2022 of roughly 24%, and we now expect that our share repurchases will reduce our outstanding share count by approximately 3% at the end of fiscal 2022 compared to the end of fiscal 2021. We still expect to generate positive cash flow from our homebuilding operations this year, and we will continue to balance our cash flow utilization priorities among our core homebuilding operations, increasing our rental inventories, maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage, and strong liquidity, paying an increased dividend, and consistently repurchasing shares.

Thank you, Paul, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Before we get started, today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R.
Although demand has slowed from the frenzy pace we experienced over the past year, there are still qualified buyers in the market today as household formations continue and inflationary pressures drive went higher. 54% of the homes we closed in the past 12 months were priced under $350,000, and our average sales price is approximately $100,000 lower than the average other public homebuilders, positioning us to continue aggregating share. There are still disruptions in the supply chain and tightness in the labor market that continue to delay the completion of our homes under construction. These construction delays and changes in demand environment led us to reduce our full year closing guidance for fiscal 2022.
Earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 53% to $4.67 per diluted share compared to $3.06 per share in the prior-year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 48% to $1.6 billion on consolidated revenue of $8.8 billion, which was in line with our expectations. Our third quarter home sales revenues increased 18% to $8.3 billion on 21,308 homes closed, up from $7 billion on 21,588 homes closed in the prior year. Continued construction delays caused by disruptions in the supply chain and tightness in the labor market caused us to close fewer homes than expected during the quarter.
As we have already mentioned, demand has moderated in June and to date in July. As we adjust to current market conditions, we expect the pace of our sales price increases to slow during the fourth quarter and for our incentive levels to increase from historical lows. To address affordability concerns, we are offering mortgage interest rate locks and buy downs to our buyers. And we are beginning to offer other sales incentives as necessary on selected homes and inventory and to drive sales traffic to our communities.
We purposefully slowed our home starts to 17,900 homes this quarter, as we work to position our inventory with an appropriate number of homes relative to market conditions. We ended the quarter with 56,400 homes in inventory, up 19% from a year ago and down 6% sequentially. 27,200 of our total homes at June 30 were unsold, of which 1,400 were completed. For homes we closed this quarter, our construction cycle time increased by roughly one week compared to the second quarter as supply chain issues remain challenging as they have for the past year.
Horton. $258 million of our finished lots purchased in the third quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had approximately $500 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 32.8%.
This revenue acceleration will likely cause our financial services revenues and profits to be lower than normal in the fourth quarter. For the quarter, 99% of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and company handled the financing for 69% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 41% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 724 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%.
Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. At June 30, we had $2.8 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $1.2 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1.6 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage was 17% at the end of June, and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 12.1%. Our consolidated leverage at June 30 was 24.9%, and consolidated leverage net of cash was 19.3%.

Horton team finished the year with a solid fourth quarter, which included a 20% increase in consolidated pre-tax income to $2.1 billion and a 19% increase in revenues to $9.6 billion. Our pre-tax profit margin for the quarter improved 10 basis points to 21.4%, and our earnings per diluted share increased 26% to $4.67. For the year, consolidated pre-tax income increased 42% to $7.6 billion on $33.5 billion of revenue, which increased 21%. Our pre-tax profit margin for the year improved 350 basis points to 22.8%, and our earnings per diluted share increased 45% to $16.51.
We closed a record of 83,518 this year in our whole building and single-family rental operations. And our homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues of 6.8% was an all-time low. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the year was 42.8%, and our consolidated return on the equity was 34.5%. Our strong financial performance during a year of significant challenges and volatility reflects the strength of our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint, and diverse product offerings.
Our homebuilding cash flow from operations for 2022 was $1.9 billion. Over the past five years, we have generated $7.5 billion of cash flow from homebuilding operations while growing our consolidated revenues by 138% and our earnings per share by 503%. During this time, we also more than doubled our book value per share, consistently kept our homebuilding leverage under 20%, and increased our homebuilding liquidity by $1.8 billion, all while significantly increasing our returns on inventory and equity. During most of the year, demand for our homes was strong.
In June, we began to see a moderation in housing demand that has continued and accelerated through today. The rapid rise in mortgage rates, coupled with high inflation and general economic uncertainty, have made many buyers pause in their home-buying decision or choose to not move forward with their home purchase. However, the supply of both new and resell homes at affordable price points remains limited and the demographics supporting housing demand remained favorable. The uncertainty of this market transition may persist for some time and could get more challenging if mortgage rates continue increasing.
However, we are well-positioned to meet changing market conditions with our experienced teams, affordable product offerings, flexible lot supply, and great trade and supplier relationships. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity, and low leverage provide us financial flexibility. We will continue to focus on turning our inventory and managing our product offerings, incentives, old pricing, sales pace, and inventory levels to beat the market, optimize returns, increase market share, and generate increased cash flow from our homebuilding operations. Mike?
Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 26% to $4.67 per share. And for the year, earnings per share increased 45% to $16.51. Net income for the quarter increased 22% to $1.6 billion. And for the year, net income increased 40% to $5.9 billion.
For homes we closed this quarter, our construction cycle time increased by a week compared to the third quarter, which reflects continued lingering supply chain issues. However, we are beginning to see some stabilization in cycle times on homes we have recently started, and we expect our cycle time to improve in fiscal 2023. We expect our start pace in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 to increase versus our fourth quarter pace, and we will adjust our starts in homes and inventory to meet the level of demand in the market. Mike?
At September 30, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 573,000 lots, of which 23% were owned and 77% were controlled through purchase contracts. Our total homebuilding lot position decreased by 25,000 lots from June to September. 29% of our total owned lots are finished and 50% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our capital-efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position.
Horton and had approximately $620 million of liquidity at year-end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 26.9%. Forestar is well positioned to meet changing market conditions with a strong capitalization, lot supply, and relationship with D.R. Horton. Bill?
We expect our financial services pre-tax profit margin for fiscal 2023 to be higher than the fourth quarter but below the full year of fiscal 2022. During the fourth quarter, 99% of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 73% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 42% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 724 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 87%.
Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible, and opportunistic. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity to provide a firm foundation for our operating platforms during changes in market conditions and to support our ability to provide consistent returns to our shareholders. During fiscal 2022, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $1.9 billion and the cumulative cash generated from our homebuilding operations for the past five years was $7.5 billion. At September 30, we had $4 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $2 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility.
Our liquidity provides significant flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. Our homebuilding leverage was 13.2% at fiscal year-end, and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 4.4%. Our consolidated leverage at September 30 was 23.8%, and consolidated leverage net of cash was 15.4%. We repaid $350 million of senior notes at maturity this quarter, and we have $700 million of senior notes that mature during fiscal 2023.
However, the low end of our current range of expectations includes consolidated revenues potentially down from fiscal 2022 by a mid-teens percentage. We forecast an income tax rate for fiscal 2023 of approximately 23% we expect to generate increased cash flow from our homebuilding operations in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, and we plan to consistently repurchase shares to reduce our share count during the year with the amount of our repurchases dependent on cash flow, liquidity, market conditions, and our investment opportunities. We plan to continue to balance our cash flow utilization priorities among our core homebuilding operations, our rental operations, maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying an increased dividend, and consistently repurchasing shares. David?
In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint, and diverse product offerings. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity, and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to operate effectively in changing economic conditions and continuing to aggregate market share. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis.

We recognized a revenue reversal of $1 billion related to the early termination of content licensing agreements with a customer in order to make that content available on our own direct-to-consumer services. Because substantially all of the consideration we received was recognized as revenue at the time that content was originally made available in previous years, we've recorded amounts to terminate the agreement net of remaining amounts of deferred revenue as a revenue reversal. Finally, a note on the impact of some tax-related items on our Q2 EPS. Our diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items of $1.08, includes an adverse impact of approximately $0.11 due to the impact of higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of a recent change in US tax regulations.
It's worth mentioning that while our annual effective tax rate has generally been correlated with the US statutory rate, there are many complex puts and takes in any given period, which can lead to these variances quarter-to-quarter. And we currently expect the full year tax rate could remain somewhat elevated above the US statutory rate. Now, as it relates to the third quarter and the second half of fiscal 2022. At DPEP, closures at our Asia theme parks could adversely impact operating income in the third quarter by up to approximately $350 million versus the prior year.",15.0,Low

Our financial results this quarter represent a turning point as we reached peak DTC operating losses, which we expect to decline going forward. That expectation is based on three factors: first, the benefit of both price increases and the launch of the Disney+ ad tier next month; second, a realignment of our cost, including meaningful rationalization of our marketing spend; and third, leveraging our learnings and experience in direct-to-consumer to optimize our content slate and distribution approach to deliver a steady state of high-impact releases that efficiently drive engagement and subscriber acquisition. With these factors, we believe we are on a path to profitable streaming business that generates shareholder value long into the future. And assuming we do not see a meaningful shift in the economic climate, we still expect Disney+ to achieve profitability in fiscal 2024, as losses begin to shrink in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.
Christine will go into more detail on the drivers of our direct-to-consumer operating performance and provide more insight into our expectations going forward and some of our key assumptions. But first, I'd like to share a few highlights from the quarter. Q4 was another strong period for parks, experiences, and products, which continue to deliver phenomenal results despite the impact of Hurricane Ian. I want to thank the amazing cast members in Orlando who went above and beyond to help keep our guests safe and entertained during the storm.
Putting this all together, assuming we do not see a meaningful shift in the macroeconomic climate, we currently expect total company fiscal 2023 revenue and segment operating income to both grow at a high single digit percentage rate versus fiscal 2022. We are confident about the opportunities we see to continue to transform our business for the next 100 years and look forward to sharing our progress with you all throughout 2023. And with that, I'll turn it back to Alexia, and we would be happy to take your questions.",15.0,Low
DIS,2023,1,"To help achieve this, we will be reducing our workforce by approximately 7,000 jobs. While this is necessary to address the challenges we're facing today, I do not make this decision lightly. I have enormous respect and appreciation for the talent and dedication of our employees worldwide, and I'm mindful of the personal impact of these changes. On the content side, we expect to deliver approximately $3 billion in savings over the next few years, excluding sports.
Like many of our peers, we will no longer be providing long-term subscriber guidance in order to move beyond an emphasis on short-term quarterly metrics, although we will provide color on relevant drivers. Instead, our priority is the enduring growth and profitability of our streaming business. Our current forecasts indicate Disney+ will hit profitability by the end of fiscal 2024, and achieving that remains our goal. Since my return, I have drilled down into every facet of the streaming business to determine how to achieve both profitability and growth.
And so, with that goal in mind, we will focus even more on our core brands and franchises, which have consistently delivered higher returns. We will aggressively curate our general entertainment content. We will reassess all markets we have launched in and also determine the right balance between global and local content. We'll adjust our pricing strategy, including a full examination of our promotional strategies.
ESPN is more than just a network. And today, the team is harnessing innovative technology to deliver spectacular coverage and entertainment to audiences who have a deep connection to the brand and content. Now, when it comes to investing in growth and returning capital to shareholders, we will take a balanced and disciplined approach as we did throughout my previous tenure as CEO when we invested in our core businesses and acquired new ones, bought back stock, and paid a dividend to our shareholders. As a result of the impact of the COVID pandemic, we made the decision to suspend the dividend in the spring of 2020.
Now that the pandemic's impacts to our business are largely behind us, we intend to ask the board to approve the reinstatement of a dividend by the end of the calendar year. Our cost-cutting initiatives will make this possible. And while initially, it will be a modest dividend, we hope to build upon it over time. Christine will provide more information on that.
Disney+ core ARPU decreased by $0.19 versus the prior quarter, driven by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact and a higher mix of subscribers to our multiproduct offerings, partially offset by a benefit from the recent domestic price increase, which occurred toward the end of the first fiscal quarter. There are a few factors worth mentioning that we expect will impact Disney+ core subscriber and ARPU growth in Q2. The Disney+ domestic price increase has been playing out as expected, with only modestly higher churn, which may also negatively impact the fiscal second quarter given the timing of the December price increase. That impact, in addition to slower than previously expected growth in some international markets, suggests core Disney+ subs may grow only modestly in Q2 at a similar pace to the first quarter.
ESPN advertising revenue in the first quarter was down 4% year over year but was roughly flat once adjusted for the CFP shift. And quarter to date, domestic cash ad sales at ESPN are pacing slightly below prior year when the two additional CFP games are adjusted out. Scatter pricing remains above upfront levels, although it has softened a bit in recent months. However, we are seeing solid advertiser interest for live events such as the Oscars, and demand across sports also remains solid.
We expect Q2 will have the most challenging comparison for Linear Networks versus the prior year and anticipate a significantly lower decline in the back half of the year. There are several factors impacting the Q2 guide that I'd like to walk through. First, recall that domestic Linear Networks operating income increased in Q1 versus the prior year, benefiting from the timing of costs under a new agreement for the NFL and a timing impact for CFP. These impacts will work against us in Q2.
We also continue to invest in our Parks and Experiences globally and in other capital projects across the enterprise and expect that fiscal 2023 capital expenditures will total approximately $6 billion. This is lower than our prior guide of $6.7 billion primarily due to decreases in capex on our domestic parks, reflecting, in part, some timing shifts. Like Bob mentioned, given our recovery from the pandemic, strong balance sheet, and commitment to cost cutting, we believe we'll be on track to declare a modest dividend by the end of this calendar year. The amount will likely be a small fraction of our pre-COVID dividend with the intention to increase it over time as our earnings power grows.
And in terms of our current outlook, as we sit here today, we still expect that revenue and segment operating income growth for this fiscal year will be in the high single-digit percentage range, and we look forward to updating you on our progress as we move forward. I'd also like to note that shortly after today's call, we will be posting a presentation on our Investor Relations website, which will summarize many of the themes that we are discussing here today.

DLR,2022,1,"Good afternoon, and welcome to the Digital Realty first quarter 2022 earnings call. Please note, this event is being recorded. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's senior vice president of public and private investor relations. Jordan, please go ahead.
Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me on today's call are CEO Bill Stein  and President and CFO Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer Greg Wright, Chief Technology Officer Chris Sharp, and Chief Revenue Officer Corey Dyer are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call.
Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.
Thanks, Jordan, and welcome to the Digital team. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework, and we made further progress on each front during the first quarter. First, we continue to globalize our business with the announcement of our definitive agreement to acquire a majority stake in Teraco in early January. We also continue to grow our business organically around the world.
We posted another record quarter of global bookings totaling $167 million of annualized rent, including our second highest quarter in each of the Americas and Asia Pacific regions, together with another solid quarter in EMEA. Bookings this quarter were led by strong results in the greater than one megawatt category, particularly in the Americas, while sub-1-megawatt bookings remain steady and in line with our 2021 average. Let's discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3 of our earnings presentation. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment and simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and broader society while advancing our goal of delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders.
During the first quarter, Digital Realty was named one of America's Most Just Companies and third overall in the real estate industry by Just Capital and CNBC. We also maintained our status as a member of the FTSE4Good Index, which measures the performance of companies demonstrating strong ESG practices, continuing our record of recognition for our leading sustainability initiatives. During the first quarter of 2022, Digital Realty continued our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts through our employee-led DEI council, which seeks to promote inclusion and create opportunities for each of our employee communities. Through the DEI council, Digital Realty has expanded its philanthropy and community engagement activities with strategic donations and partnerships with global charitable organizations.
Our active development pipeline reached an all-time high in the quarter with 44 projects underway supporting over 300 megawatts in of IT capacity in 28 metros around the world. 58% of this capacity is already presold, reflecting strong customer demand. We've expanded our development in the Americas, adding further capacity in New York, Northern Virginia and Toronto. Demand remains very strong in EMEA, and we are continuing to invest across this region with active development projects in 17 of our 18 markets.
We are also proactively managing risks to help insulate Digital Realty against the impact of the current inflationary and rising interest rate environment. We are well protected against the impact of rising energy costs given the pass-through nature of substantially all of our customer contracts, and we are effectively managing against rising input costs through our vendor-managed inventory program and the expansion of our prepurchase equipment pool. We are constructively engaging with new and existing customers on the impact of rising costs, which is translating into better pricing. This is partly reflected in the broad-based and improved cash leasing spreads we experienced in the first quarter but is also showing up in new lease transactions across most of our markets.
Our leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on Platform Digital. Our customers continue to solve the most complex IT infrastructure in activity and data integration challenges. We see a growing trend of multinational companies across all segments deploying and connecting large private data infrastructure footprints on platform digital across multiple regions and metros globally. Recently, industry research firm, IDC, updated their global data sphere forecast for 2025, Predicting the annual data creation rate will exceed 180 zettabytes per year or roughly triple the '21 rate.
IDC concludes that companies of all sizes will need to prioritize data sharing and security to improve business resiliency and create a differentiated experience for their customers. Earlier this week, we published our inaugural Global Data Insights survey with strategic insights from 7,200 companies across 23 countries and nine industries about the role of data in their business agenda. According to the survey, 70% of these companies are prioritizing secure data exchange in their current plans. The global data survey will augment our Data Gravity Index to provide telemetry for our customers, partners and their respective industries as they evolve their business platforms to harness the power of data and co-located infrastructure to unlock a new era of growth through connected data communities.
Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform in meeting these needs, we believe that we are well-positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.
Consistent with our full year guidance, same capital cash NOI growth was negative 3.1% in the first quarter, primarily driven by 220 basis points of FX headwinds, the timing of no move-outs and a customer bankruptcy. The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen over the last several months, and FX represented a 200 to 250 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our first quarter reported results from the top to the bottom line, as shown on Page 11. Our operations, along with our capital funding and locally denominated debt act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective.
Turning to our risk mitigation strategies on Page 12. A little less than 60% of our first quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars, followed by approximately 25% in euros and roughly 5% each in Singapore dollars and British pounds. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing.
Given our strategy of matching duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in SOFR would have roughly a 75 basis point impact on full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed, and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, first quarter core FFO per share of $1.67 was flat on both a year over year and sequential basis. Despite FX headwinds, a $0.01 impact related to a customer bankruptcy and a difficult comp due to the contribution of assets to digital core REIT.
In terms of the quarterly run rate, we expect the split between the first half of the year and the second half of the year to be approximately $49.51. In other words, as you can see from the bridge chart on Page 13, we expect to dip down a couple of pennies in the second quarter due to normalized opex spending and near-term dilution from closing the Teraco transaction before bouncing back in the second half of the year as leases from a record backlog commenced. Most of the drivers underlying our guidance remain unchanged, but given the improving pricing environment, we are bumping up our outlook for cash releasing spreads for the full year to slightly positive compared to flat last quarter. We are maintaining our existing core FFO per share range of $6.80 to $6.90 despite the customer bankruptcy and stiffer FX headwinds.
Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, we expect currency headwinds could represent a 250 to 300 basis point drag on full year 2022 revenue and core FFO per share growth. Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 14. We were active again in the capital markets during the first quarter.
A little over three-quarters of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform while also acting as a natural FX hedge for investments outside the U.S. Over 90% of our debt is fixed rate, guarding against a fixed a rising rate environment, and 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 15, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years.
Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?",13.0,Low
DLR,2022,2,"Good afternoon, and welcome to the Digital Realty second quarter 2022 earnings call. Please note that this event is being recorded. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's senior vice president of public and private investor relations. Please go ahead.
Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and president and CFO, Andy Power. Chief investment officer, Greg Wright; chief technology officer, Chris Sharp; and chief revenue officer, Corey Dyer are also on the call and will be available for Q&A.

For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.
Our second quarter results were strong with $113 million of new bookings and core FFO per share of $1.72, a 12% increase over the second quarter of last year and a 3% sequential increase, despite stiff FX headwinds. The dialogue with our customers surrounding the evolving supply demand dynamic and our compelling value proposition has started to translate with price increases driving positive cash renewals, supporting our push for appropriate rent escalators, and helping to maintain stable development returns. Despite generally higher prices, demand for data center solutions remains strong around the world. with notable productivity in each of our regions.
Service Fabric Connect is the first of several related interconnection-oriented products that we have on our roadmap and was launched with availability in over 30 markets around the world. We are excited to bring this product to life, and we look forward to delivering these enhanced connectivity benefits to our customers. Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to invest in our global platform through a combination of organic new market entries that enhance our global productivity offerings as well as existing market expansions that are designed to meet our customers' longer-term capacity and connectivity solution requirements.
Finally, we have received the necessary regulatory approval in South Africa to close on the acquisition of Teraco, a leading colocation and interconnection provider in South Africa. We now expect to close the transaction within the next two weeks. Our active development pipeline remains robust and grew by more than 10% sequentially with 41 projects underway, supporting over 360 megawatts of IT capacity in 18 strategically important metros around the world. More than half of this capacity is already presold, reflecting strong customer demand.
Given the dynamism of the current environment, we know how important it is to make sure that we are being appropriately compensated for the elevated risk throughout the capital markets and the broader economy. We have sought to mitigate these risks through our VMI program, appropriate pricing adjustments, and CPI-based rent escalators that help insulate us from the impact of higher operating costs throughout the life of our customer contracts. Finally, as we have discussed in the past, we remain focused on opportunistically culling our portfolio. Since the end of 2019, we have monetized over $4 billion of assets through a combination of outright sales, joint ventures, and more recently, through the contributions to our Singaporean Capital Partner Digital Core REIT.
We view these sales and contributions as an important source of capital raising as we continue to expand our diverse global portfolio and accelerate our growth. Before turning it over to Andy, I'd like to highlight an important update to our board and then discuss the success we were having with other ESG initiatives shown on Page 5 of our earnings presentation. In June, Mary Hogan Preusse, a 30-year REIT industry veteran was named chairman of the board, succeeding Lawrence Chapman. Mary has served on our board since 2017 and has played a critical role in driving Digital Realty's expansion and innovation as we have pursued our transformation to being a global full spectrum data center provider.
In addition to publishing our fourth annual ESG report, we became the first data center operator to achieve the milestone of one gigawatt of sustainably certified data center capacity. We also further expanded our renewable portfolio in the U.S. by contracting for 158 megawatts of new solar energy before the recent run-up in power prices, supporting our data centers in California and Georgia. Globally, 119 of our data centers are powered by 100% renewable energy.
We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.
Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. As Bill noted, we signed total bookings of $113 million with a $12 million contribution from interconnection during the second quarter. New business was healthy across product types as sub-one megawatt plus interconnection accounted for 42% of the quarter's bookings, while deals larger than a megawatt accounted for 57% of this quarter's bookings.
The weighted average lease term on new leases was more than seven years. EMEA accounted for well over half of this quarter's new business as Frankfurt continued to set the pace in the region, while Paris was also a meaningful contributor. Leasing was also geographically broad based during the quarter with significant contributions from Northern Virginia, Athens, Zurich, Tokyo, Sao Paulo, New York, Dublin, and Amsterdam. Reflecting the strength of demand from our customers, we grew the size of our development pipeline to more than 360 megawatts under construction as we started over 100 megawatts of new projects in EMEA and North America, including 35 megawatts in Frankfurt and 38 megawatts in Paris.
A lag between signings and commencements moved up to 13 months due to one larger signing into a new campus development in Frankfurt. Excluding that lease, the sign of commencement period was more in line with our recent experience of about eight months. Moving on to Page 10. We signed $173 million of renewal leases during the second quarter at a positive 3.4% cash releasing spreads compared to 3.3% positive last quarter.
Renewal rates were positive in each product segment and also in each of our three regions. The majority of total renewals were sub-one megawatt deals, reflecting the higher unit price contracts that are characteristic of that segment. These renewals climbed by 3% during the second quarter. Among larger deals, rates increased by 1.1%.
Most of this space has already been released and will more fully commence over the next several quarters, which should drive an improved trend in revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Turning to our risk mitigation strategies on Page 11. 57% of our second quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars, with 22% in euros and 7% in Singapore dollars, 6% British pounds, and 2% in Japanese yen.
We have also actively mitigated interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt or longer-term fixed-rate financing. Turning back to currency. The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen over the last several months, and FX represented a 400 to 450 basis point drag on year-over-year growth in our second quarter reported results from a top to the bottom line, as shown in our constant currency analysis on Page 12.
As we've highlighted in the past, currency fluctuations has more typically served as a 50 to 100 basis point headwind or tailwind to earnings in periods of lower volatility. While the outsized depreciation of the euro this year has been a major driver of the headwinds for our P&L, it also represents the lion's share of our $4 billion-plus development pipeline. To be clear, we are operating and then investing locally rather than repatriating proceeds into U.S. dollars.
Our operations and our investment pipeline along with our capital funding and locally denominated debt serve as a natural hedge. Of course, given the growth of our global portfolio, along with the heightened FX volatility, we will continue to evaluate our hedging strategy on an ongoing basis. In terms of earnings growth, second quarter core FFO per share of $1.72 was 12% higher on a year-over-year basis and 3% higher sequentially, despite increased FX headwinds. The outperformance versus our prior expectations for the quarter was principally a function of lower-than-expected opex spend and a short delay in the closing of the Teraco transaction.
Looking forward, we expect core FFO per share will remain under pressure from stiffer than expected FX headwinds given the appreciation of the U.S. dollar. As you can see from the bridge chart on Page 13, we expect FFO will dip down a couple of pennies in the third quarter, principally due to FX, but also as a result of the delayed normalization of opex spend, near-term dilution from closing the Teraco transaction and higher interest rates. Accordingly, we have adjusted our underlying guidance assumptions that remain under pressure from foreign currency exchange and interest rates.
We are also updating our core FFO per share guidance range for the full year 2022 to $6.75 to $6.85, reflecting a $0.05 per share adjustment at the low and high end of the range. Importantly, we are reaffirming our constant currency core FFO per share range of $6.95 to $7.05 for 2022. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, we expect currency headwinds could represent a 300 to 400 basis point drag on full year 2022 revenue and core FFO per share growth.
Lastly, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 14. Our reported leverage ticked down to 6.2 times as of June 30th, while fixed charge coverage increased to 6.0 times. Adjusting for the proceeds from the last September's forward equity offering, our pro forma leverage drops to 5.8 times, while fixed charge coverage improved to 6.2 times. We remain focused on our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related cost of our liabilities.",13.0,Low
DLR,2022,3,"Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's third-quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are CEO, Bill Stein; and president and CFO, Andy Power; chief investment officer, Greg Wright; chief technology officer, Chris Sharp; and chief revenue officer, Corey Dyer, also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to GAAP net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. One important item to note this quarter, while Teraco's results are consolidated into our financial statements since closing on August 1, we have excluded the platform's contribution from leasing backlog and other portfolio statistics that will be cited on this call and within our third quarter earnings materials.
Thank you, Jordan, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call. The world has experienced significant change so far in 2022, and Digital Realty is adapting to that change. Our business continues to be levered to powerful long-term secular demand trends, broadly driven by ongoing digital transformation and the growth in IT and data as our record leasing results underscore. We also have an unmatched global operating footprint that is supported by a strong development pipeline that allows us to capture opportunities wherever they may emerge.
As you all understand, global capital markets have become extraordinarily volatile and interest rates have risen sharply from historic lows to levels that we have not seen since 2008. At the same time, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against the euro to levels not seen in nearly 20 years. While you've had to look back over 30 years to find the last time the dollar was this elevated against the pound or the yen.
This volatility is being driven by a number of factors from a global economy emerging from the pandemic to the war in Ukraine and, of course, the heightened resolve of central bankers to tap down on elevated global inflation. And while the underlying fundamentals of our business remain strong and fortune can indeed favor the brave, experience has taught us that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. And we feel that it is most prudent today to adapt to the current environment by, one, prioritizing and sharpening the lens through which we view new investments to ensure that we are focused on the most strategic transactions that offer the highest potential risk-adjusted returns; two, by pressing our newly gained advantage on pricing and improving our internal growth profile and the longer-term durability of our cash flows; and three, by enhancing liquidity to ensure that we have the capital to meet the commitments that we have made to our customers while maintaining a comfortable cushion. With over 300 data centers around the world and a revenue base of over $4.5 billion, Digital Realty remains focused on how to best position ourselves for the long run.
It enables us to leverage platform digital to capitalize on value-creation opportunities and harvest capital once those facilities have stabilized. We also favor joint ventures like the one in Israel, where we leverage the local knowledge and expertise of our partner and pair that with PlatformDIGITAL to expand our global footprint and to better serve our customers. Before turning it over to Andy, I'd like to update you on our ESG success shown on Page 3 of our earnings presentation. We were honored to be recognized by GRESB as the sector leader for technology and science category in the Americas for the second consecutive year, maintaining our five-star rating from this leading investor-driven ESG benchmarking organization.
We are proud of our ESG-related efforts. And while the awards and recognition are nice, we are focused on ESG because our customers demand it, and because quite simply, it is the right thing to do. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.
These deals drove additional starts within our development pipeline, which grew to over 400 megawatts, but is also now more than 60% pre-leased mitigating much of the risk related to this capital spend and providing significant visibility into future revenue. As Bill touched on in his remarks, we signed four leases in the quarter with a large multinational financial services customer that has fully embarked upon its digital transformation journey. This large multi-site, multi-market build-to-suit transaction drove the upside in our greater than one megawatt North America leasing and also served to increase our development pipeline sequentially while reducing our anticipated yields. Importantly, this deal is structured as a yield on cost development supported by a long-term triple net lease to a strong investment-grade credit with fixed escalators, which serves to insulate Digital Realty from construction costs, and operating expense volatility.
Despite this result, we are confident in a slightly positive cash-releasing spread for the full year 2022. Importantly, we are encouraged by the general trajectory of market rents across our product line. We expect that the dislocation and volatility of capital markets coupled with rising costs and the reduced availability of power in several markets, including the world's largest market, Loudon County, Virginia, is constraining the ability to bring on new data center capacity despite the secular demand for data center infrastructure. With regard to power delivery in Northern Virginia, we are continuing to work with the primary power provider to ensure appropriate allocations with an acute focus on capacity needed to support our customers in this market.
This is disappointing on the surface but once the noise is removed, the improving operating picture that we have been painting starts to emerge. On a constant-currency basis, data center operating revenue, rental revenue interconnection was actually up 10 basis points year over year and improved by 120 basis points sequentially, demonstrating the turn that has started to take hold in our core operations. The sequential step-up was supported by a 50-basis-point occupancy improvement over the second quarter, along with the benefits of the positive releasing spreads we've seen year to date. Turning to our risk mitigation strategies on Page 9.
56% of our third quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars, with 21% in euros, 6% in Singapore dollars, 5% in British pounds, and 2% in Japanese yen. The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen over the last few months, negatively impacting same capital revenue growth by 530 basis points and NOI growth by 480 basis points year over year, as shown in our constant-currency analysis on Page 10.
This strong headwind contrasts with typical FX impacts of 50 to 100 basis points in either direction during the periods with more normal FX volatility. While the outsized depreciation of the euro this year has been a major driver of the headwinds for our P&L, it also represents the lion's share of our development pipeline. To be clear, we are operating and then investing locally rather than repatriating proceeds into U.S. dollars.
Our operations, investment pipeline, and funding in locally denominated debt serve as a natural hedge. As we discussed on our call last quarter, given the growth of our global portfolio, along with heightened FX volatility, we took a closer look at our hedging strategy during the third quarter and executed additional swaps to mitigate our remaining FX exposure. In August, we executed a U.S. dollar-to-euro currency swap against an existing $1 billion tranche of 2027 notes outstanding.
The reported core FFO underperformance versus our prior expectation for the quarter was purely a function of greater-than-expected FX headwinds. Looking forward, we expect core FFO per share will remain under pressure from stiff FX headwinds given the appreciation of the U.S. dollar, though this should be offset by core growth. As you can see from the bridge on Page 11, we expect FFO will remain flat sequentially in the fourth quarter as FX and interest expense headwinds are partly balanced by NOI growth.
A review of our leverage is on Page 12. Our reported leverage ratio at quarter-end was 6.7 times, while fixed charge coverage is at 5.5 times. We drew $400 million down from last September's forward equity offering as part of our funding for Teraco. So, pro forma for the remaining forward equity and adjusting for our full quarter's contribution from Teraco, our leverage ratio drops to 6.4 times while pro forma fixed charge coverage is 5.7 times.
While leverage is above our historical average, we have bolstered our liquidity to ensure that we have the capital in hand to fund our committed development spend throughout the end of next year and maintain a comfortable cushion. Since our last earnings call, we have raised or received commitments for approximately $2 billion of debt capital at an effective blended average of just over 3%. These include more than $650 million of term loan commitments received subsequent to quarter-end. With cash and forward equity outstanding totaling more than $700 million, we have increased our current available liquidity to approximately $3 billion.
As you can see from the chart on Page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is about five and a half years, and our weighted average coupon is 2.4%. Approximately three-quarters of our debt is non-U.S. dollar-denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. More than 80% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling.",13.0,Low
DRI,2022,1,"As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com.
Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. As you saw from our release this morning, we had a very good quarter. Our teams continue to operate effectively in a challenging environment. And I'm proud of their focus and ability to deliver another quarter of strong sales and profitability. All of our segments delivered record first quarter profit. Our ability to drive profitable sales growth is a testament to the strength of our business model and our continued to adherence this strategy we implemented six years ago. Our brands remain laser focused on executing our back-to-basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service and atmosphere, while at the Darden level, we concentrate on strengthening and leveraging our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning, and our results-oriented culture.
Regardless of the operating environment, our unwavering commitment to our strategy ensures we will stay focused on what we do best, providing exceptional guest experiences. Throughout this unique period, our operators have shown tremendous flexibility, while remaining locked in on the fundamentals of running great restaurants. At the same time, our focus helps us continue to find ways to make our competitive advantages work even harder for us.
For the quarter, off-premise sales accounted for 27% of total sales at Olive Garden and 15% of total sales at LongHorn Steakhouse. Digital transactions accounted for 60% of all off-premise sales during the quarter, and guest satisfaction metrics for off-premise experiences remained strong. As we navigate short-term external pressures, our focus is simple. We must continue to win when it comes to our people and product.
From a people perspective, the employment environment is challenging. That's why our top priority during the quarter was staffing our restaurants. Our operators and HR teams have done a great job sourcing talent. We recently launched a new talent acquisition system that helps increase our pool of candidates by allowing applicants to apply and schedule an interview in five minutes or less. Additionally, our brands are successfully utilizing their digital platforms, including social media to promote our employment proposition and drive applications. As a result, we are netting more than 1,000 new team members per week, and our team member count is approximately 90% of our pre-COVID levels.
The biggest operational challenge we've been dealing with is a temporary exclusion of team members identified through contact tracing. Given our commitment to health and safety, we are diligent about exclusions, but they create sudden staffing disruptions for our operators. Despite being appropriately staffed in the majority of our restaurants, these exclusions reduce the number of available team members with little notice for our operators to prepare. This volatility can negatively impact sales in these restaurants for the duration of the exclusion period. Getting and staying staffed also requires a strong focus on training. As we continue to hire, it is critical that we have the right training in place to ensure we continue to execute at a high level. That's why our operations leaders are validating the quality of our training during their restaurant visits, ensuring new team members receive the appropriate amount of training and successfully complete the required assessments.
Our team members are the heart and soul of our business, and we are constantly focused on our employment proposition. The investments we have made and continue to make in our people are helping us retain and attract top talent, and I'm confident in our ability to address our staffing needs. When it comes to product, our significant scale, including our dedicated distribution capabilities, enables us to manage through the challenges affecting the global supply chain and maintain continuity for our restaurants. Our supply chain team continues to work hard to ensure we successfully manage through any spot outages we encounter, and our restaurants have the key products they need to serve our guests.
During the quarter, we had to secure more product than usual on the spot market, because our brands exceeded sales expectations and some of our suppliers experienced capacity challenges. Raj will share more details in a moment, but these higher sales volumes, as well as freight costs have contributed to higher-than-expected inflation. Our scale advantage provides the opportunity for us to price below our competition and inflation, which is a strategy we have executed successfully. Our competitive advantage of extensive data and insights allows us to be surgical in our pricing approach, positioning us well to deal with these higher costs and maintain our value leadership. The rich insights we gather from our analytics help us find the right opportunities to price in ways that minimize impact to traffic over time. We still expect pricing to be well below the rate of inflation for the year, further strengthening our value proposition.
Now looking at the P&L for the first quarter of 2022, we're providing a comparison against pre-COVID results in the first quarter of 2020, which we believe is a more comparable to normal business operations and with how we've been talking about our margin expansion. For the first quarter, food and beverage expenses were 150 basis points higher, driven by investments in both food quality and pricing significantly below inflation. Restaurant labor was 110 basis points lower, driven primarily by hourly labor improvement, due to efficiencies gained from operational simplifications and was partially offset by elevated wage pressures. Restaurant expenses were also 110 basis points lower due to sales leverage. Marketing spend was $45 million lower, resulting in 220 basis points of favorability. As a result, restaurant-level EBITDA margin for Darden was 20.9%, 290 basis points better than pre-COVID levels.
G&A expense was 30 basis points higher, driven primarily by approximately $10 million of stock compensation expenses related to the immediate expensing of equity awards for retirement eligible employees. Additionally, we had approximately $5 million of expense related to mark-to-market on our deferred compensation. As a reminder, due to the way we hedge this expense, it's largely offset on the tax line. These impacts were partially offset by savings from corporate restructuring implemented in fiscal 2021
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 12.6%, which benefited from the deferred compensation hedge I just mentioned. Excluding this benefit, our effective tax rate would have been closer to the top end of our guidance range for the year.",28.0,Medium
DXC,2022,1,"Good day. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to DXC Technology Q1 fiscal-year '22 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. John Sweeney, vice president of investor relations.
Today's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information to our investors. In accordance with SEC rules, we provided a reconciliation of these measures to their respective and most comparable GAAP measures. These reconciliations can be found in the tables included in today's earnings release and on the webcast slides. Certain comments we make on the call will be forward-looking statements.
These are known and uncertain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed on the call. A discussion of these risks and uncertainties is included in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings. I'd now like to remind our listeners that DXC Technology assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this call, except as required by law. And with that, I'd like to introduce DXC Technology's president and CEO, Mike Salvino.
Thanks, John, and I appreciate everyone joining the call today, and I hope you and your families are doing well. Today's agenda will begin with a quick update on our solid Q1 performance, which continues to show that revenue, adjusted EBIT margin, book-to-bill and non-GAAP EPS all have a positive trajectory compared to past quarters. During our Investor Day in June, we gave you additional insights into the steps of our transformation journey, and those steps are: inspire and take care of our colleagues, focus on our customers, optimize costs, seize the market and build a strong financial foundation. I will give updates on each step, and then hand the call over to Ken to share our Q1 financial results, guidance and more details on how we are building a strong financial foundation.
The goals of this phase are: first, continue to increase our employee engagement, all while we attract and retain highly talented colleagues; second, stabilize year-on-year organic revenue; third, expand adjusted EBIT margins; fourth, consistently deliver a book-to-bill number of 1.0 or greater, with a nice mix of new work and renewals; and finally, under Ken's leadership, deliver a financial foundation that increases discipline and improves our cash flow and earnings power. Now I will discuss the good progress we are making on each step of our transformation journey, beginning with inspire and take care of our colleagues. We are executing a people-first strategy. Attracting and retaining talent is fundamental to enable our growth.
Our refreshed leadership team has deep industry experience and is delivering. Brenda, who is our chief marketing officer, is our newest addition. Brenda is a strategic results-oriented leader who brings deep marketing experience to DXC. 75% of our leadership team is now new to DXC and bringing in talent based on their personal credibility as talent follows talent.
In Q2, we are planning merit increases that will benefit roughly 77,000 of our colleagues. In addition to these investments, we are doing a great job of taking care of our colleagues and their families during the pandemic. This focus on our colleagues is unique and builds trust with them, increases employee engagement, allows us to compete for talent and enables us to deliver for our customers. Focus on our customers is the second step of our transformation journey.
Our investment in our customers is the primary driver of revenue stabilization. During the Investor Day presentation, I couldn't be more proud to have you hear from American Airlines, FedEx, P&G, Lloyd's, Brighthouse, Deutsche Bank, Campbell's and Microsoft. And I want to thank them again for their support and partnership. It was clear from their comments that the new DXC story is resonating with them because we are delivering.
Thank you, Mike. Turning to our financial performance on Slide 12. For the quarter, DXC exceeded the top end of our revenue, margin and earnings guidance, and continued to deliver a strong book-to-bill. GAAP revenue was $4.14 billion, $10 million higher than the top end of our guidance range.
Adjusted EBIT margin was 8% in the quarter, an improvement of 380 basis points as compared to the prior quarter. In Q1, bookings were $4.6 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.12, the fifth straight quarter of a book-to-bill greater than one. Moving on to Slide 13. Our Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.84 or $0.08 higher than the top end of our guidance, benefiting $0.05 from a lower tax rate.
Restructuring and TSI expenses were $76 million, down 58% from prior year. Free cash flow was a use of cash of $304 million, as compared to a use of cash of $106 million in the prior year. We expect free cash flow to improve significantly as the year progresses. As the next slide shows, our Q1 FY '22 performance continues our trajectory as we deliver on our transformation journey.
Starting with organic growth progression, we went from approximately 10% decline in the first three quarters of FY '21 to down 6.5% in the fourth quarter and now down to a decline of 3.7%. This is a 40% improvement from the prior quarter. Let me highlight our organic revenue growth calculation, and our prior-year earnings releases was structured to provide the year-over-year deconstruction of revenue changes into FX, acquisitions, dispositions and organic compared to prior-period GAAP revenue. Our previous organic revenue growth calculation was not performed in this manner.
To put this decline in perspective, last year, this business declined almost 20% year over year. We expect this momentum to continue and organic declines to further abate as the year progresses. Modern workplace revenues were $577 million, down 19.7% as compared to prior year. Book-to-bill was 1.0 in the quarter.
We expect to reduce this from an average of $900 million per year over the last four years to $550 million in FY '22 and about $100 million in FY '24. On Slide 19, we detail our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet. We are proud of what we achieved on this front, reducing our debt by $7 billion, while improving our net debt leverage ratio to 0.9 times. Further, we have reached our targeted debt level of $5 billion with relatively low maturities through FY '24.
From our improved balance sheet, let's move to cash flow for the quarter. First-quarter cash flow from operations totaled an outflow of $29 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was negative $304 million. As you likely realize, with Mike's leadership, we will continue to make decisions to better position the company for the longer term, creating a sustainable business.
Certain of these decisions impacted cash flow this quarter. As our guidance anticipated, we plan to take certain actions that impacted the Q1 cash flow. We remain on track to deliver our full-year free cash flow guidance of $500 million. Let's now turn to our financial priorities on Slide 21.
We are working to build a stronger financial foundation and use that base to drive the company forward in a disciplined and rigorous fashion, unleashing DXC's true earnings power. Our second priority is to have a strong balance sheet. We achieved our targeted debt level. We are encouraged by our almost 50% year-over-year interest expense reduction.
Additionally, we paid down $300 million of capital leases and asset financing in order to allow us to dispose of IP hardware purchased under the previously mentioned take-or-pay arrangement and realizing tax deduction once we dispose of the unutilized assets. Given our relatively low borrowing cost, it makes less sense to enter into capital leases as the borrowing costs are higher and creates other complexities. We continue to reduce capital lease and asset financing origination from approximately $1.1 billion in FY '20 to $450 million in FY '21 and believe that we will remain at that level or lower for FY '22. As we continue to curtail capital lease origination, our average quarterly lease payment will reduce from about $230 million a quarter in FY '21 to about $170 million near term.
Our efforts to limit capital leases does create upward pressure on capital expenditures. Though, on balance, we expect to reduce cash outflows for both capital leases and capital expenditures over time. Lastly, we terminated our German AR securitization program, negatively impacting cash flow by $114 million for the quarter. Going forward, this will result in interest savings, strengthen our balance sheet, but more importantly, it will bring us closer to our customers as cash collections is tied to their success.
This translates into organic revenue declines of down 1% to down 3%. Adjusted EBIT margins of 8% to 8.4%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.80 to $0.84. As we look forward to the rest of the year, I would note that we expect $175 million of tax payments in Q2 related to the gains on dispositions.
We also updated our FY '22 interest guidance to approximately $180 million, a $20 million improvement; and reduced our full-year non-GAAP tax rate by 200 basis points to 26%. As noted on Slides 23 and 24, we are reaffirming our FY '22 and longer-term guidance. Lastly, we expect to see further improvement in the quarterly year-over-year organic revenue growth rates as we move through the year. With that, I will now turn the call back to Mike for his closing remarks.
Thanks, Ken. Let me leave you with three key takeaways. First, I couldn't be more pleased with the trajectory of the business. Our improvement in revenue, margins and EPS is evident, and we expect this success to continue.
These three key takeaways show that we have good momentum, we are building the foundation for growth, and we are confident that we will deliver on our financial commitments. With that, operator, please open the call up for questions.",16.0,Negligible
DXC,2022,2,"This call is being webcast at dxc.com's Investor Relations website, and the webcast includes slides that will accompany the presentation today. Today's presentation will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information to our investors. In accordance with SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of these measures to their respective and most comparable GAAP measures. These reconciliations can be found in the tables included in today's earnings call on the webcast slides.
Certain comments we make on this call will be forward-looking statements. These are known and uncertain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed on the call. A discussion of these risks and uncertainties is included in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings. I'd now like to remind our listeners that DXC Technology assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this call, except as required by law.
Thanks, John, and I appreciate everyone joining the call today, and I hope you and your families are doing well. Today's agenda will begin with an update on our Q2 performance, which shows hard evidence that we are delivering on our transformation journey and building the foundation to make DXC operationally efficient, sustainable and ultimately grow. Next, I will provide you with additional insights as to the operational work we are performing as we execute our transformation journey. Then I will hand the call over to Ken to share our Q2 financials, guidance and more details of the financial results driven by our strong operational execution.
Finally, I will make some closing remarks before opening the call up for questions. Regarding our Q2 performance, our revenues were $4.03 billion. Our organic revenue growth continued to show progress as we improved from minus 3.7% in Q1 to minus 2.4% in Q2. Also, I was very pleased to see that the GBS business segment grew for the second quarter in a row from positive 2% in Q1 to positive 3.4% in Q2.
We also continue to improve the organic revenue of the GIS business segment from minus 9.1% in Q1 to minus 8% in Q2. Now all of these results show our organic revenue is on the right trajectory. Our adjusted EBIT margin was 8.6% and was driven by the operational work that we are doing to optimize our business. This is the third straight quarter of both improving organic revenue growth and sequential margin expansion, and we expect both trends to continue in Q3.
Book-to-bill for the quarter was 0.91, which came in below our goal of one due to the timing of a couple of deals. I'm happy to report that both deals are hybrid cloud/ITO deals and are now closed. We continue to track to a book-to-bill over one year to date, and we expect to be back above 1.0 in Q3. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.90 in the quarter, which is up $0.41, as compared to $0.64 a year ago.
We are executing a people-first strategy, and attracting and retaining talent is fundamental to enable our growth. We know our strategy is working. We saw a higher percentage of our employees complete our September employee engagement survey, and we are showing improved and stable engagement scores. These engagement scores give us confidence that we have a motivated workforce, and we will be able to manage attrition, which we've seen an uptick.
To offset this increase in attrition and demand, we hired and onboarded more colleagues than any other quarter since I became CEO. Key advantage to our hiring efforts is that we have implemented and are running a virtual-first model. Hiring has been a focus for us and will continue. While hiring improved, we left some open demand and project work unconverted.
And we are focused on capturing this moving forward. Focus on the customers is the second step of our transformation journey and continues to be the primary driver of our success in improving our organic revenue growth. A key metric that we measure is our Net Promoter Score, and we are seeing continued improvement. The last time we gave you our NPS score was during the Investor Day in June, and it was 18, almost within the industry best practice range of 20 to 30.
This represents our third consecutive quarterly improvement. As you can see, we have come a long way from double-digit organic revenue declines in Q1 FY '21 to low single-digit declines in FY '22. Our adjusted EBIT margin continues to improve as well, delivering 8.6% in Q2, up 60 basis points as compared to the first quarter. Year over year, our adjusted EBIT margins have expanded 240 basis points or 460 basis points, excluding the disposed businesses.
Moving to our segment results on Slide 12. Our GBS segment continued its strong growth performance, posting its second quarter of positive organic revenue growth of 3.4%, an improvement from 2% in the first quarter. The GBS growth is a positive sign as we continue to deliver higher value for our customers. Our GBS business has higher margins and lower capital intensity.
The two deals Mike mentioned earlier that slipped out of Q2 that were subsequently closed were in the ITO and Cloud and Security layers of our technology stack and would have boosted our GIS book-to-bill for the quarter to over 1.1. Lastly, Modern Workplace revenues were $581 million, down 10.9% as compared to prior year. This is an improvement from last quarter when Modern Workplace was down 19.7% year over year. Book-to-bill was 1.2 and 1.1 year to date.
Next up, let me touch on our efforts to build our financial foundation. This quarter, we made particularly strong progress on strengthening our balance sheet and solidifying our financial position, cash generation and reducing restructuring and TSI expense. As Mike pointed out earlier, we've made measurable improvements driving our business to improve our financial foundation that will ultimately allow us to increase our deployable cash affording us more opportunities to create value. We reduced our debt from $12 billion to $5.1 billion.
We also continue to deliver on reducing restructuring and TSI expense while increasing our margins. This not only improves our cash flow, it also narrows the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. Finally, capital lease and asset financing is an area that was overused. In the last year or so, we've significantly curtailed new capital lease originations from $1.1 billion in FY '20 and are on track to reduce originations to approximately $500 million this year.
These efforts to better manage this form of financing allowed us to reduce our debt and ultimately our capital lease cash outflows from $245 million in Q1 FY '21 to $177 million this quarter. We expect further reductions in our quarterly cash outflows to around $150 million per quarter at the end of FY '22 and further below that level going forward. We delivered these reductions while also better managing capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures were reduced from $225 million in Q1 FY '21 to $159 million Q2 FY '22.
Based on our reductions to capital lease originations, a more meaningful metric to demonstrate our progress is capex spend and capital lease originations as a percent of revenue. Capex and capital lease originations as a percent of revenue were 10.2% for FY '20, 8% for FY '21 and now down to 5.3% for Q2 FY '22. Delivering 5.3% is a good step forward related to better managing our capital spend as it gets us in the peer range, albeit at the top end and is a proof point of our improved operational rigor. Returning to our debt on Slide 16, I want to spend a minute on our recent refinancing.
This chart shows how the refinancing further solidifies our financial position. By extending maturities, we now have no bond maturities before FY '26, lowering maturity towers and reducing annual interest expense and cash outflows by about $50 million a year. From our improved balance sheet, let's move to cash flow. Cash flow from operations totaled an inflow of $563 million.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $404 million, up 33% compared to prior year and moves us to positive free cash flow for the first half of FY '22 of $100 million. The second quarter was impacted by previously disclosed cash tax payments related to business disposals, accelerated interest payments due to our refinancing and a payment related to restructuring a vendor relationship to take greater control over our delivery. Further, as part of our strategy to focus on customers, we were able to better manage working capital in the quarter. As we look to the second half, we expect the fourth quarter free cash flow to be stronger.
Our third quarter has two discrete nonrecurring cash payments, including a $60 million payment associated with a legacy vendor that has a take-or-pay agreement and a $90 million payment associated with COVID relief legislation where we deferred certain tax payments and now have opted to accelerate the tax payments to utilize the tax deduction. Slide 18 shows our trended free cash flow profile. The negative cash flow over the last three quarters was due in large part to absorbing a number of nonrecurring cash outflows of over $1.7 billion to put the business on a better trajectory, building our foundation. These cash outflows include: $700 million tax payment associated with taxable gains on our divestitures; $500 million to normalize vendor payments; $332 million related to readying the U.S.
state and local health and human services business for sale; $114 million to end an AR securitization program; $88 million to end a value-destructive take-or-pay agreement; the $1.7 billion headwinds put into perspective; the $749 million trailing four quarters negative free cash flow. A key driver of improving cash flow is to continue to reduce our restructuring and TSI spend. Our restructuring and TSI efforts are highly focused, and we believe are a prudent investment in the business addressing our outsized cost structure in certain countries and to reduce our facilities footprint to align to our virtual model. We remain on track to reduce restructuring in TSI from an average of $900 million per year over the last four years to $550 million in FY '22 and about $100 million in FY '24.
I would like to take a moment to update our capital deployment expectations from Investor Day. The Investor Day chart called for 55% of our free cash flow to be used to pay debt and capital lease obligations. As a result of our progress, our cash outflows for debt and capital lease financing are now expected to be about 20% of our free cash flow. That leaves 80% of our expected free cash flow to invest in our business and/or repurchase our stock.
I should note, we like the business we have and believe that we have the right level of investment in GBS and GIS. We believe our technology stack has critical mass and capability at each layer. We believe we will create more value by continuing to focus on driving the transformation journey across our business, improving the fundamentals and continuing to build organic growth up the stack, ultimately delivering 1% to 3% organic growth in FY '24. Related to acquisitions, our focus is to ensure our platinum channel strategy will be fully vetted and proven out.
So eventually, when we are acquisitive with tuck-in sized acquisitions, we will have a clear path to deliver value. Related to our debt, we have a clear line of sight to achieving our targeted debt level of $5 billion near term as we have scheduled debt repayments via our capital lease financing and commercial paper. Our preference is to maintain approximately $2.5 billion of cash on hand to fund an appropriate level of working capital. When we have cash in excess of $2.5 billion, we will determine how best to deploy the cash as we do not expect to leave significant levels of excess cash, generating no meaningful returns on our balance sheet for an extended period of time.
At this point in our journey, we favor share repurchases as our valuation is attractive. In Q2, we repurchased $83 million of our common stock, bringing the FY '22 year-to-date repurchases to $150 million or 3.9 million shares. Our share repurchases are a disciplined approach to capital allocation and are expected to be self-funding using a rather simple formulaic approach of deploying cash in excess of $2.5 billion when we are at our target debt level of approximately $5 billion. We remain very focused on our investment-grade credit profile.
Turning to our third quarter guidance. We expect revenue between $4.08 billion and $4.13 billion. If exchange rates were at the same level as when we gave guidance last quarter, our third quarter revenue guidance range would be $90 million higher. Organic revenue decline improved to down 1% to down 2.5%; adjusted EBIT margin of 8.6% to 8.9%.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.88 to $0.93 per share. We are pleased by our progress as we look to the second half of FY '22. I would like to update our current fiscal year guidance. Based on the strengthening U.S.
dollar, our revenues are expected to be negatively impacted by approximately $200 million, which has been reflected in our revised guidance range of $16.4 billion to $16.6 billion; reaffirming organic revenue growth at down 1% to down 2%; increasing adjusted EBIT to a range of 8.5% to 8.9%; increasing non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to $3.52 to $3.72 per share; and reaffirming free cash flow guidance of $500 million. We are reaffirming our guidance for FY '24. This reflects our strong execution in driving forward on our transformation journey. Before I turn the call back to Mike, I want to reflect a moment as I'm closing out on my first year at DXC.
We are clear-eyed on the value we are driving with the transformation journey. We feel strongly there is more opportunity in front of us to continue to improve the business and the underlying economics. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Mike for his closing remarks.
We're then taking our GBS offerings to our Platinum customers, selling up the enterprise technology stack. The evidence that this is working is in our organic revenue results of GIS, GBS and the overall company. This also gives us confidence that we will achieve our FY '24 guidance of 1% to 3% growth. In closing, I'm confident that by staying focused on our transformation journey of building the foundation, we will continue to deliver in the short term and ultimately deliver our long-term financial targets of margin, growth and free cash flow.",16.0,Negligible
DXC,2022,3,"Thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. I'm pleased that you're joining us for DXC Technology's third quarter 2022 earnings call. Our speakers on the call today will be Mike Salvino, our president and CEO; and Ken Sharp, our EVP and CFO. This call is being webcast at dxc.com, investor relations, and the webcast includes slides that will accompany this discussion today.
Today's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information to our investors. In accordance with SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of these measures to their respective and most directly comparable GAAP measures. These reconciliations can be found in the tables included in today's earnings release and in the webcast slides. Certain comments we make on the call will be forward-looking.
These statements are subject to known and uncertain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed on the call. A discussion of these risks and uncertainties is included in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings. I would now like to remind our listeners that DXC Technology assumes no obligation to update the information presented on the call except as required by law. And with that, I would like to introduce DXC Technology's president and CEO, Mike Salvino.
Thanks, John, and I appreciate everyone joining the call today. And I hope you and your families are doing well. Today's agenda will begin with an update on Q3, which was another strong quarter of operational execution for DXC. Next, I will cover how we are consistently delivering on our transformation journey.
As a result of this execution, organic revenue, margin, and EPS all continue to improve. In addition, you will see the outstanding results for book-to-bill and free cash flow. The best part about this performance is we expect it to be sustainable. And then I will hand the call over to Ken to share our Q3 results along with our Q4 and full year guidance.
While the quarter was strong across the board, the 2 strongest financial results were book-to-bill and free cash flow generation. We delivered $5 billion in bookings for a book-to-bill of 1.23 times. This gets us to a book-to-bill of 1.08 times on a trailing 12-month basis. And in Q3, we delivered $550 million in free cash flow.
Now let me turn to the progress we are making on our transformation journey. The first step of the journey is to inspire and take care of our colleagues. Hiring was a major focus of ours. And we ramped up our hiring engine to meet the high level of demand and to activate more project work.
A great example of this strategy working is the new agreement with Lloyd's. When I started DXC a little over two years ago, Lloyd's was contemplating a significant reorganization without DXC, which would have caused a negative impact to our revenue. Running Lloyd's' mission-critical systems well has built trust that enabled us to be chosen to build the future at Lloyd's, which will be the most advanced insurance marketplace in the world. DXC will rearchitect and develop a cloud-native platform running on AWS to replace their legacy mainframe platform.
We have identified businesses with roughly $500 million in revenues that are not strategic and will not help us grow. Selling these businesses will improve our organic revenue growth and our overall margin. We expect the sale of these businesses to result in an additional $500 million in proceeds within the next 12 months. At the same time, we are focused on prudently investing in assets that will enable us to grow.
And this is helping us with our organic revenue growth, significantly limiting the declines from double-digit to low single-digit negative declines. Modern Workplace is following a very similar path. Our strong 12-month book-to-bill of 1.1 times gives us confidence that, like ITO, we can take this business from double-digit to low single-digit decline in the next 12 months. Analytics and Engineering is a great story as we are converting our strong book-to-bill of 1.29 times on a 12-month basis and growing this business 18.7% in Q3, which is helping us consistently grow our GBS business.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.92, up $0.08 compared to the prior year. Our earnings per share expanded despite $0.23 of headwinds from taxes. The tax rate headwinds were more than offset by increased margins and lower interest expense. Moving to our segment results on Slide 12.
Our GBS profit margin was 16.2%, up 200 basis points compared to the prior year. GIS organic revenue declined 8.3%. GIS profit margin was 4.8%, an improvement of 110 basis points compared to prior year. Our focus with GIS heretofore has been on improving delivery, to deliver for our customers while stabilizing the margins.
For our GBS layers of our technology stack, our book-to-bill was 1.28 times and 1.17 times on a trailing 12-month basis. Cloud and Security revenue was $471 million and organic revenue was down 12.2%. IT Outsourcing revenue was $1.11 billion and organic revenue was down 1.9%. Let me remind you that this business declined 19% in Q3 FY '21.
And our strong book-to-bill of 1.11 times over the trailing 12 months is expected to stabilize Modern Workplace as we move through FY '23. For our GIS layers of the technology stack, our book-to-bill was 1.18 times and 1.01 times on a trailing 12-month basis. As you think about organic revenue growth prospects for GIS, our focus on improving the quality of revenue by expanding margins, reducing capital intensity and driving cash flow may create headwinds for organic revenue growth. For example, using our capital to buy laptops, bearing the risk and ultimately recovering our cash over three to four years with relatively low returns does not feel like a great economic model.
At the end of the day, we would prefer to provide our offerings and services and forego the revenue associated with buying the assets to improve the underlying economics. Next up, let me touch on our efforts to build our financial foundation. This quarter, we made particularly strong progress with cash generation and continued reduction of restructuring and TSI expense. With regard to financial discipline, remediating our material weakness is a top priority.
We are in the late stage of our efforts to remediate the material weakness, and we have fully implemented our 11-point remediation plan. As a result, we expect to remediate our material weakness in Q4. I should note, as it relates to the material weakness in governance more holistically, we are clear-eyed on how we think about governance. We do not find our current governance score to be acceptable.
This reduction contributed $195 million to cash flow during the quarter as compared to the prior year. Further, this also achieves one of our goals of narrowing the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. I should note that while we have been reducing restructuring and TSI expense, we have also been able to expand margins. Lastly, as you can see, we have also reduced operating lease cash payments from $156 million in the third quarter of the prior year to $117 million in the third quarter of FY '22.
We expect this timing to create some headwinds in Q4 cash flow. Slide 18 shows our trended cash flow profile. Our progress in Q2 and Q3 gives us confidence as we work toward delivering our longer-term FY '24 guidance of $1.5 billion in free cash flow. Moving to Slide 19.
Let's revisit our relatively simple capital allocation formula. We are targeting a debt level of approximately $5 billion and a cash level of $2.5 billion. With debt at our target debt level, cash over $2.5 billion is excess cash, which we expect to deploy. Based on this formula, we expect to self-fund stock repurchases of $1 billion over the next 12 months.
As noted in the liquidity section of our previously filed financials, the German financial services business has cash held on deposit for the bank's customers. The current cash balance related to these deposits is $670 million. We also announced an agreement for the sale of our Israeli business for $65 million. The valuation for these assets are accretive to our valuation.
Our share repurchases are self-funded. As noted, we expect to repurchase $1 billion of our common stock over the next 12 months as we firmly believe our stock is undervalued. Turning to the fourth quarter guidance. Revenues between $4.11 billion and $4.15 billion.
If exchange rates were at the same level as when we gave guidance last quarter, our fourth quarter revenue guidance range would be $20 million higher. Organic revenue declined, minus 1.2% to minus 1.7%. Adjusted EBIT margin in the range of 8.7% to 9%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.98 to $1.03 per share.
For Q4, we expect a tax rate of approximately 26%. As we look to the end of FY '22, I would like to update our current fiscal year guidance. Based on the strengthening U.S. dollar, our revenues are expected to be negatively impacted by approximately $40 million.
We now expect to come in at approximately $16.4 billion. Organic revenue growth range of minus 2.2% to minus 2.3%, which is slightly lower than our previous range. Adjusted EBIT margin, 8.5% to 8.6%. We continue to expand margins while significantly lowering restructuring and TSI expense and are now guiding to $400 million for FY '22.
To put this all in context, we expect to spend $500 million less on restructuring and TSI spend than last year, while expanding margins by over 200 basis points. Our focus is to embed these types of expenses over time into the normal performance of the business and believe we have taken significant strides in doing so. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.64 to $3.69. Lastly, we are increasing free cash flow guidance to over $650 million, $150 million improvement to our prior FY '22 guidance.
Fourth quarter cash flow is expected to be impacted by timing, which boosted Q3 cash flow and in addition, a $100 million payment in Q4 to terminate a financial structure put in place a number of years ago. We are reaffirming our guidance for FY '24. This reflects our strong execution and driving forward on our transformation journey. Overall, we are making great progress driving efficiency in the business and generating strong free cash flow.
Strengthening the balance sheet. Our debt is now at $4.9 billion, and our refinancing has significantly lowered our interest expense. Achieved organic revenue growth of minus 1% to minus 2% in FY '22. This is where we're coming up a little short, anticipating negative 2.2% to negative 2.3% organic revenue growth.
Remediate material weakness and improve governance score. As Ken indicated, we will remediate the material weakness in Q4, and we have plans to continue to improve our governance score. Reduce restructuring and TSI. We have taken it from over $900 million to roughly $400 million in FY '22.
Our portfolio-shaping is anticipated to drive $500 million in excess cash in the next year. In closing, I am confident that by staying focused on our transformation journey, we will continue to deliver on our commitments both in the short term and the long term. And with that, operator, please open the call up for questions.",16.0,Negligible
DXC,2022,4,"Thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. I'm pleased that you're joining us for DXC Technology's fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. Our speakers on the call today will be Mike Salvino, our president and CEO; and Ken Sharp, our EVP and CFO. This call is being webcast at dxc.com Investor Relations, and the webcast includes slides that will accompany this discussion today.
Today's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information to our investors. In accordance with the SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of these measures to their respective and most directly comparable GAAP measures. These reconciliations can be found in the tables included in today's earnings release and in the webcast slides. Certain comments we make on the call will be forward-looking.
These statements are subject to known and uncertain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed on the call. A discussion of these risks and uncertainties is included in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings. I'd now like to remind our listeners that DXC Technology assumes no obligation to update the information presented on the call, except as required by law. And with that, I'd like to introduce DXC Technology's president and CEO, Mike Salvino.
The next two slides show quantitatively and qualitatively the progress we have made that has put DXC in a dramatically better place. Beginning with the numbers, we narrowed the total organic revenue decline by 620 basis points. Our growth strategy has two parts: consistently grow GBS and shrink the negative declines in GIS. We have achieved the first part of our growth strategy by consistently growing GBS for four consecutive quarters in FY '22.
While we did shrink the organic revenue declines in GIS, we expected better results, which we plan to achieve in FY '23. Considering adjusted EBIT margins, we delivered a 230-basis-point increase, and our non-GAAP diluted EPS was up $0.44. The highlight of the year was our free cash flow performance. We drove $743 million in free cash flow.
Our second commitment was to exit Russia. In April, we exited the Russian market and successfully took care of our customers and colleagues of that business. This action fulfilled DXC's commitment to exit the region and will reduce our revenues by approximately $140 million per year. Our solid execution of these commitments has enabled us to have strong customer retention, has made our business better, and position us to effectively deal with the conflict as it continues.
As we move into FY '23, our leadership team knows what we need to do within GBS and GIS. This clarity gives me confidence that the momentum created in FY '22 will continue in FY '23. GBS is a business that we've consistently grown and is comprised of a set of digital offerings that are high value for our customers and for DXC. This business is highlighted by our engineering offering, which enables DXC to help our customers grow.
In fact, a number of our customers refer to us as their growth partner. We use deep engineering skills to create products, services, and experience that make our customers more relevant and vital to their customers. An example is our relationship with one of the world's largest automotive manufacturers. Car buyers want a digital experience that will help them minimize disruption to their vehicles, and we all know cars are full of sensors that produce all sorts of data.
Other income increased due to a gain on sale of assets. In total, adjusted EBIT margin expanded 100 basis points. Interest benefited from our debt retirement and refinancing. Q4 was $4 million higher than anticipated due to unwinding a legacy financial structure.
Adjusted EPS is up 13.5%, boosted by increased EBIT margin, lower interest, and a lower share count. Our EPS for Q4 came in below our guidance by $0.14 due to three items aggregating $0.17: $0.04 Russian invasion of Ukraine; $0.06 increased European utility costs; and $0.07 higher tax rate. For FY '23, we expect additional costs related to taking care of our colleagues in exiting Russia of $50 million, and our tax rate will be back to a normalized level of 25%. Turning to our segment results.
A key part of Mike's strategy is to continue to improve the business mix and ultimately move GBS to be a larger portion of the business. For the quarter, our GBS mix improved 160 basis points to 47.2%. GBS continues with its fourth consecutive quarter of organic growth of 3.4%. GBS growth was impacted by about 150 basis points due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
We continue to work plans to move the GIS margin forward. As Mike articulated, our growth strategy has two parts: first, consistently grow GBS, which we feel good about; second, moderate the GIS organic revenue declines. We see early success with our IT Outsourcing business. Our GBS and GIS businesses are each comprised of three offerings.
Slide 14, debt was reduced to our target debt level and remain there the entire year. Interest is down significantly. And restructuring and TSI expense were reduced $565 million. We also reduced operating lease payments by $132 million.
Lastly, capital expenditures and capital lease originations as a percentage of revenue was 7% in FY '22, down from roughly 10% in FY '20, and presents a significant opportunity to improve cash generation as we look forward. Slide 15 demonstrates how our progress translates into improved cash flow. Our performance in the last three quarters of FY '22 provides a solid platform to build off in FY '23 and ultimately gives us confidence as we work toward delivering our longer-term guidance of $1.5 billion in free cash flow. I should note, this cash improvement has come while we've been reducing capital leases and related financing payments that sit outside of free cash flow.
Cash flow from operations in the quarter totaled an inflow of $271 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was $93 million. For the full year, we delivered $743 million of free cash flow, exceeding our initial guidance of $500 million. As Mike mentioned earlier, our financial foundation is in a much better place.
We achieved a lot in the year, improving transparency into our performance, strengthening our balance sheet, significantly improving free cash flow, reducing restructuring and TSI expense, and executing on our capital allocation program. Now that our financial foundation is much improved, we will pivot to providing more details on our business optimization efforts, particularly focused on improving GIS margins led by our chief operating officer, Chris Drumgoole. Turning to Chart 18. Let me expand a bit on what Mike discussed earlier that improving GIS economics is a top priority.
Cost optimization. There's clearly a lot of opportunity in front of us, whether it is addressing our underutilized data centers and office buildings, software agreements, contractors, delivery standardization, or offshore mix. We feel that we have enough levers to improve the GIS margin to circa 10%. We believe, more than ever, we can make these changes as the competitive landscape has improved.
As part of our efforts to pass say-on-pay, we have proactively engaged many of our shareholders, obtained their feedback, and used their feedback to reshape our pay practices. You can see the improvements we committed to make that will be fully detailed in our proxy. Turning to our FY '23 guidance. Revenue of $14.9 billion to $15.05 billion.
Two key items we are addressing in our revenue guidance. Foreign currency is expected to be a headwind of 4.6% or almost $800 million based on the strengthening U.S. dollar, divestitures that are announced and closed, lower revenue by approximately 2% or about $300 million. We have additional divestitures in process, including Fondsdepot Bank, and we'll update you accordingly.
Organic revenue growth of minus 1% to minus 2%, which is a combination of continued growth in GBS and moderating declines in GIS. Adjusted EBIT margin of 8.5% to 9%. Our margin guidance takes into consideration $100 million decline in our noncash pension income for FY '23 and a $50 million of costs associated with taking care of our colleagues in Ukraine and Russia as we reposition our business to put it in a better place and exit Russia. The noncash pension income is due to expected returns on our pension assets exceeding pension costs as several of our pension plans are overfunded.
We are focused on locking down these plans and further de-risking our balance sheet. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, $3.85 to $4.15, or a 15% growth at the midpoint. Free cash flow, $800 million. Our guidance for the first quarter of FY '23.
Revenue of $3.7 billion to $3.75 billion. Foreign currency is estimated to be 6% or about $250 million headwind. Divestitures are expected to reduce revenue by about $100 million. Organic revenue decline of 1.5% to 2.5%.
This reflects our strong progress on our transformation journey and our belief in the company's capability to execute over the next two fiscal years. As we think about our FY '24 goals, it's important to realize how far we've come as we've improved the transparency of the financials and the investability of DXC. We improved year-over-year cash generation by $1.4 billion. We tackled the issues that negatively impacted our ability to generate and hang on to cash.
Our Analytics and Engineering business will emerge in a far better place. It is more resilient, has a more diversified global delivery platform, and has lower geopolitical risk. While this situation is unfortunate, we have been able to manage it well, and it has not and will not have a significant impact on our business. Over the last two and a half years, it is clear that we have put DXC in a far better place, and I'm excited to embark on FY '23.
My leadership team has clarity on the actions that we need to accomplish on our portfolio and how to improve its trajectory. We fully expect our momentum to continue and deliver longer term. And with that, operator, please open the call up for questions.",16.0,Negligible
DXC,2023,1,"Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased that you're joining us today for DXC Technology's first quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings call. Our speakers today on the call will be Mike Salvino, our chairman, president, and CEO; and Ken Sharp, our EVP and CFO. The call is being webcast at DXC Investor Relations, and the webcast includes slides that will accompany this discussion today.
Today's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information to our investors in accordance with SEC rules to provide a reconciliation of those measures to their respective and most directly comparable GAAP measures. These reconciliations can be found in the tables included in today's earnings release and in the webcast slides. Certain comments we make on the call will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to known risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed on the call.
A discussion of these risks and uncertainties is included in our annual report on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. I'd now like to remind our listeners that DXC Technology assumes no obligation to update information presented on the call, except as required by law. And with that, I'd like to introduce DXC Technology's chairman, president, and CEO, Mike Salvino. Mike? 
Thanks, John, and I appreciate everyone joining the call today, and I hope you and your families are doing well. Today's agenda will begin with an overview of our Q1 results. Next, I will update you on the progress we are making with our transformation journey. Ken will then discuss our financial results in more detail and our updated guidance.
And finally, I will make some closing remarks before opening the call up for questions. Our transformation journey is creating value. But as you can see with the shortfalls in the quarter, we need to do better. The good news is we have the right plan for FY '23.
We are laser-focused on executing this plan with my team of operators, and the work that needs to be accelerated is within our control. We've done a nice job of investing in our business that has produced a stronger quality company and deeper customer relationships that have positively changed our reputation in the industry. When I talk about the quality of company that we are, I want to highlight, we continue to improve our free cash flow generation. Debt and capital allocation is being well managed.
We have portfolio-shaped and sold off businesses that were distractions to our strategy. We have consistently grown GBS and narrowed the declines of GIS while moving our revenue mix toward the higher value business of GBS. And finally, we've improved our governance significantly. Concerning customer relationships, the NPS score that we communicated during these calls shows that we now have deep customer relationships because we are delivering.
Book-to-bill was 0.87 in the quarter. This shortfall was within our control. We purposely pushed out deals in the areas of ITO and Modern Workplace due to poor economics. All that being said, we are currently at a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.06, and we expect to be back over one in Q2.
This means we will continue to hire for the businesses that are growing, like GBS, and to scale the offshore presence of our global delivery network. The fourth step is seize the market. Our Q1 book-to-bill of 0.87 was a direct result of more disciplined dealmaking, and our trailing 12-month book-to-bill is still a healthy 1.06. New work for the quarter was 57% and renewals were 43%.
Deals are coming our way, and we are being very disciplined in our dealmaking. Providers have given customers aggressive deals in the past with hopes that they can improve the economics over time, and the old DXC was part of that trend. We all know that these deals were hard to economically make work. The new DXC is focused on doing good deals from the start.
And although this disciplined dealmaking may have a short-term impact on our book-to-bill, we believe that it will help us longer term improve margins and deliver for our customers. All that being said, we expect Q2 to be back over one. And finally, I am pleased with the financial foundation and how far we have improved the quality of DXC over the last couple of years. We're doing a nice job improving free cash flow and the business is producing results that has helped us manage our debt below $5 billion.
Thank you, Mike. Turning to our progress on the transformation journey. We continue to move forward on our key initiatives. Q1 organic revenue declined 2.6%, 10 basis points or $4 million below the bottom end of our guide.
Net interest expense is favorable, benefiting from lower interest expense and higher interest income. EPS was down $0.09 compared to prior year and was impacted by $0.12 from lower margins, $0.10 from unfavorable FX rate movements, $0.02 from the higher tax rate. These impacts were partially offset by $0.15 due to lower interest expense and a lower share count. For revenue, the continued strengthening of the U.S.
dollar is resulting in $1 billion of headwinds or an additional $374 million from our prior guidance. FX is having a more meaningful impact on margins due to a higher concentration of cost in U.S. dollars. Year over year, FX is negatively impacting adjusted EBIT margin by approximately 50 basis points or an additional 25 basis points of margin impact from our prior guidance.
Next, let's turn to our segment results. We continue to see improvement in the business mix as GBS becomes a larger portion of the business. For the quarter, GBS increased 180 basis points to 47.4% of total revenue. GBS has consecutively grown for five quarters and is our higher-value business with higher margins and lower capital intensity.
Modern Workplace was down 16.1%, an improvement from the fourth quarter of down 19.6%. We expect to see continued improvement in Modern Workplace throughout FY '23. The GIS book-to-bill has been impacted by our increased pricing discipline Mike mentioned earlier. We have taken a more disciplined approach to ensure we achieve reasonable economics that appropriately cover our cost of capital.
At the end of the day, we believe the market realizes for large-scale IT infrastructure-type work, DXC is the safe pair of hands. We believe our competition has been forced to be more rational. As a result, we expect to be able to sign work with better economics. Slide 16 demonstrates how DXC continues to benefit from its financial foundation.
Debt continues to decline due primarily to FX impacts on euro-denominated debt. Currently, about 60% of the outstanding debt is euro-denominated. At $4.8 billion in debt, we are below our target debt level of $5 billion. We continue to reduce our restructuring and TSI-related cash outflows.
In FY '23, we expect to repay $500 million of capital leases, reducing debt. Based on our efforts to better manage fixed asset purchases via capital leasing, we expect to reduce borrowings in FY '23 to approximately $200 million of capital lease originations. So, between the capital lease repayments and the lower originations or borrowings, our debt would be reduced by an approximately $300 million. The $300 million of capital lease debt reduction provides flexibility to either borrow for capital allocation by staying at our target debt level or further delever.
Foreign currency is expected to be a headwind of 7.2% or almost $290 million year over year. Divestitures are expected to reduce revenue by about $93 million, organic revenue growth of minus 1.5% to minus 2.5%. Adjusted EBIT margin, 7% to 7.5% as we continue to face headwinds from higher cost as a percent of revenue and FX. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.70 to $0.75.
We expect margins to improve through the second half of the year as we execute on our cost optimization efforts. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.45 to $3.75, down $0.40 from our prior guidance. Free cash flow of $700 million reduced by $100 million. We are reaffirming our guidance for FY '24.
Thanks, Ken. And let me leave you with a few key points. Our transformation journey is creating value, and we are confident that we are taking the right steps for DXC in the short term that will set us up for success longer term. I'm pleased with the quality of the company DXC has become with our stable debt, sound capital allocation strategy, free cash flow generation focus, investment-grade profile, improved governance, and our consistent growth in GBS.",16.0,Negligible
DXC,2023,2,"Thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. I'm pleased that you're joining us for DXC Technology's second quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings call. Our speakers on the call today will be Mike Salvino, our chairman, president and CEO; and Ken Sharp, our EVP and CFO. The call is being webcast at dxc.com/investorrelations, and the webcast includes slides that will accompany the discussion today.
Today's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe provide useful information to investors. In accordance with the SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of these measures to their respective and most directly comparable GAAP measures. These reconciliations can be found in the tables included in today's earnings release and in the webcast slides. Certain comments we make on the call will be forward-looking.
These statements are subject to known risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed on the call. A discussion of these risks and uncertainties is included in the annual report on our Form 10-K and other SEC filings. I'd now like to remind our listeners that DXC Technology assumes no obligation to update the information presented on the call except as required by law. And with that, I'd like to introduce DXC Technology's chairman, president and CEO, Mike Salvino.
Thanks, John, and I appreciate everyone joining the call today, and I hope you and your families are doing well. Today's agenda will begin with an overview of our Q2 results. Next, I will update you on the progress we are making on our transformation journey. Our Q2 results show that our transformation journey is back, producing the kind of results that we've grown accustomed to.
I firmly believe that our engineering and software development capability is one of the best-kept secrets, but we are gaining momentum changing this perception. In GIS, our sales organization is oriented toward RFP-focused selling, which is highly price competitive. We continue to implement a disciplined sales approach with the deals we are bringing into GIS. Our belief is we can be disciplined as customers are seeking us out against our competition because of our strong delivery reputation.
And finally, I'm pleased with our financial foundation and the steps we have taken to make DXC a quality company. Our debt and our capital allocation are two steps that I would like to highlight. We have effectively managed our debt below our target level of $5 billion. Our debt in Q2 was $4.5 billion, down from $4.8 billion in Q1.
Adjusted EBIT margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were at the top end of our guidance range at 7.5% and $0.75, respectively. Free cash flow of $17 million, leaving us a little better than breakeven free cash flow for the first 6 months of the year. We expect our FY '23 free cash flow will be back-end loaded, similar to last year. As you recall, we delivered over $700 million of free cash flow last year.
Given the global nature of our business, let's put the FX headwinds for the full year in context compared to prior year. Revenue is expected to be negatively impacted by $1.2 billion, a $200 million increase from our prior guidance. Adjusted EBIT is expected to be negatively impacted by $130 million and 25 basis points of margin. EPS is expected to be negatively impacted by $0.40.
The FX impact to profit impacts cash flow by $100 million. About 60% of our debt is denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. FX reduced our debt by approximately $400 million since our refinancing.
Cloud infrastructure and IT outsourcing had a strong quarter with a decline of 0.9%, that was better than our expectation. This is good performance as we saw almost 20% declines just two years ago. Modern Workplace was down 16.9% and continues to underperform our expectations. We believe we've made the right investments in Modern Workplace and expect to see the revenue declines moderate.
Turning to our financial foundation on Slide 16. Debt is down to $4.5 billion and below our target debt level of $5 billion. We recently entered into a $500 million term loan that is undrawn to provide us additional financial flexibility. We continue to tightly manage our restructuring and TSI expenses.
The facility sales may create losses on disposal that would impact our non-GAAP results. As our guidance does not include any estimate for these losses, we will be sure to break these out separately in the future to the extent they occur. Related to our $1 billion share repurchase, we did not repurchase any shares in the quarter due to interest received from a financial sponsor. As you know, we are halfway through the $1 billion share repurchase.
Adjusted EBIT margin in the range of 8% to 8.5%. We expect margins to improve through the second half of the year based on accelerating our cost optimization efforts. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.45 to $3.75; free cash flow of $700 million. Year-to-date, our free cash flow has been negatively impacted by lower customer bank deposits of about $100 million held in our German banks.
Our guidance assumes customer bank deposits increased $100 million back to about $600 million. Services companies don't traditionally own banks and it can create an unusual free cash flow movement as customer bank deposits change. We are reaffirming our FY '24 guidance. With that, let me turn the call back to Mike for his final thoughts.
These repeatable drivers of our business allow my leadership team to now focus on the future versus the past and gives us the confidence in achieving our FY '24 goals.With that, operator, please open the call up for questions.",16.0,Negligible
DXC,2023,3,"This call is being webcast at dxc.com. Investor relations webcast includes slides that will accompany this discussion today. Today's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information to our investors. In accordance with the SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of these measures to the respective and most directly comparable GAAP measures.
The reconciliations could be found in the tables in today's earnings release and in the webcast slides. Certain comments we make on the call will be forward-looking.

Thanks, John. And I appreciate everyone joining the call today, and I hope you and your families are doing well. Today's agenda will begin with an overview of our strong Q3 results, where our execution drove record bookings along with margin, EPS, and free cash flow that all exceeded expectations. Next, I will discuss our transformation journey and how it has helped us drive these strong results.
However, our organic revenue grew for the second consecutive quarter sequentially, and it is notable that we have driven the same level of revenues in constant currency, excluding dispositions for all three quarters in FY '23. Our adjusted EBIT increased from 7.5% in Q2 to 8.7% in Q3, highlighting the strong execution of our cost optimization efforts while not negatively impacting our customers. Our non-GAAP EPS increased to $0.95. Our book-to-bill of 1.34 is the strongest book-to-bill result since I've been CEO.
I am proud of how we are taking care of our roughly 4,000 colleagues in the Ukraine, and we continue to be impressed by their resiliency to take care of their families and our customers. Concerning COVID-19, we were just awarded the President Certificate of Commendation in Singapore. This prestigious honor has awarded organizations that made exceptional efforts, which had a significant impact in Singapore's fight against COVID-19. I want to thank the women and men of DXC, along with my leadership team for their continued execution.
This solid customer delivery has driven sequential organic revenue growth in constant currency for two quarters in a row. The key thing I would like to highlight is that we have now delivered roughly the same level of revenue in constant currency, excluding dispositions for all three quarters in FY '23, and you will hear from Ken that we are guiding to a fourth quarter at a similar organic level. Now, this is a great accomplishment as we have been a company with declining revenues for the past several years. Also, you will see our strategy for GBS and GIS working.
You will hear from Ken that we were able to generate approximately $375 million of cash from the sale of data centers in the quarter, along with the German banks in early January. In the area of seize the market, I am extremely pleased with our bookings this quarter. A record book-to-bill of 1.34 brought us back to over 1.0 on a year-to-date basis for FY '23, and this shows strong momentum as we are completing FY '23 and heading into FY '24. In GBS, all three offerings delivered a book-to-bill of over 1.0, and we continue to see momentum in our engineering and software capabilities that we discussed last quarter.
It is clear that there is demand in the market for our offerings, and we need to be patient because we are taking work from our competition at better economics. Our final step is our financial foundation, where we generated $463 million of free cash flow this quarter. The execution in this area was outstanding, and it gives us great momentum to hit our yearly guide for free cash flow. This free cash flow result, along with the cash we generated from portfolio shaping, including the sale of the German banks in January, totaled $840 million.
Thank you, Mike. Let me provide you a quick rundown of our Q3 performance. Q3 organic revenue declined 3.8%. Adjusted EBIT margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were above the top end of our guidance range at 8.7% and $0.95, respectively.
Free cash flow was $463 million in the quarter. The team is making great progress with what we expect will be two consecutive years of positive cash flow of at least $630 million. This is quite a turnaround from two years ago with over $650 million of negative free cash flow. Moving to our key financial metrics.
As a result, adjusted EBIT margin was flat compared to prior year and up 120 basis points sequentially. EPS was up $0.03 compared to the prior year due to $0.08 from a lower share count, $0.06 from a lower tax rate, $0.02 from lower interest expense. These benefits were partially offset by $0.13 from lower revenue and FX. Let's turn to our segment results.
Insurance, software and BPS is up 3%. Our insurance software business is about $550 million of annual revenue and grew approximately 7% in the quarter. Security was up 4.2%. Cloud infrastructure and IT outsourcing declined 5.4%.
Modern Workplace was down 15.3%. We are encouraged by the recent new logo wins. Let me tie the year-over-year organic revenue decline above with Mike's earlier point on sequential quarterly revenue. I am pleased to note that we've delivered three quarters of revenues that are flat on a constant currency, excluding divestitures basis.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $463 million on January 3. We closed the sale of our German banks. Customer deposits were $70 million lower as compared to the start of the year, thus creating a free cash flow outflow. With the sale of our German banks for EUR 300 million, we have substantially completed our $500 million portfolio shaping and asset proceeds goal.
Last quarter, we announced a new $250 million asset sale proceeds goal. While selling these real estate assets will bring in real cash, we expect to incur a noncash loss that is not incorporated in our guidance. In Q3, we closed on four facility sales, yielding $56 million of cash proceeds, and recognized a $16 million gain. The combination of our Q3 free cash flow, sale of our German banks, and our Q3 asset sales delivered $840 million in cash.
To put a finer point on the $840 million of cash, it is over 12% of our market capitalization. We expect to deploy $400 million to repay a portion of our debt, and we'll adjust our target debt level to $4.5 billion. With the bank sales, customer bank deposits are no longer part of our cash balance. Accordingly, we are reducing our target cash balance to $1.8 billion.
Organic revenue decline of minus $2.6 million to minus 2.7%. Adjusted EBIT margin of 8% to 8.1%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.45 to $3.50. As I mentioned earlier, our free cash flow was negatively impacted by $70 million due to lower customer bank deposits held in our German banks.
Accordingly, free cash flow was adjusted to $630 million. As Mike and I reflected on our FY '24 guidance we gave almost two years ago, we envisioned a business that could grow with solid margins and good quality cash flow. We still envision that same business today. Let me provide you some context on our original FY '24 guidance.
At the time, organic revenue was declining double digits, and we guided to organic revenue growth of 1% to 3%. Adjusted EBIT margins were approximately 6%, including 190 basis points of noncash pension income, and we guided to a 10% to 11% margin. Free cash flow was negative $650 million, and we guided to $1.5 billion of free cash flow. Lastly, let us not forget the $900 million of annual reoccurring restructuring and TSI costs that we guided to $100 million, all while expanding margins.
We are assuming pension income continues at a similar level and is a 65-basis-point headwind from our original FY '24 guidance. Free cash flow to increase above FY '23 levels, but do not expect to exceed $900 million. When we set our FY '24 $1.5 billion free cash flow guidance, we had $900 million of capital lease payments. The capital lease payments are not part of free cash flow, but we're a significant consumer of free cash flow, leaving $600 million of cash generation.
Thanks, Ken, and let me leave you with a key takeaway. We will achieve our inflection point at the end of FY '23 and deliver the business we have always envisioned in FY '24, albeit with slightly lower guidance. As we exit FY '23, you can see that we have cleaned up many of the challenges from our past that Ken just outlined. Our clear execution of our transformation journey has built a quality company that you can depend on to deliver revenue that is not declining, change the mix of the revenue to the higher-value tech offerings of GBS, expand both margins and EPS, win new work in the market as our offerings are relevant and in demand, generate strong free cash flow, manage our debt and return cash to shareholders.
Now, this is great execution, but we didn't come here to DXC to fix the challenges. With the momentum that we've created in the business, we have confidence that we are poised to deliver the business we had envisioned in FY '24 as we can see the ability to drive revenue flat to 1% growth, expand both margins and EPS, rotate the revenue to the new tech of GBS and generate increased free cash flow. Getting this inflection point was no small task, and my management team and I are proud of the quality company we have created, along with being clear and excited about the future of DXC. And with that, operator, please open the call up for questions. ",16.0,Negligible
ETN,2022,1,"And I'd say we're also executing well on our strategic growth initiatives as noted here on Slide 4. Highlighted here are several new wins tied to the secular growth trends that we're focused on. We've talked about electrification, energy transition and digitalization. Overall, we continue to see an acceleration in each of these important growth drivers and are convinced that we have the right growth strategy.
In the interest of time, I'll highlight one of these recent wins, but we're happy to provide more detail on a follow-up call. While we're not at liberty to disclose the customer, we had another very significant win on an energy transition project. This was a very large follow-on order for EV charging stations in the U.S., where we're providing the full suite of Eaton solutions, including power distribution equipment, entity storages, inverters, control automation and remote monitoring software. And we continue to work on a number of big opportunities focused on building out the needed electrical charging infrastructure given the explosive growth in electric vehicles.
And this was primarily the Cobham and the Tripp Lite acquisitions, offset by the divestiture of hydraulics. Our acquisitions added 6 points of growth, while the divestiture of hydraulics reduced growth by 12 points. We also had negative FX of 1% in the quarter. Second, with 3% revenue growth, we posted solid operating leverage with 9% growth in operating profits and even stronger adjusted growth and -- adjusted EPS growth of 13%.
And just as a comparison, this compares with 5% in Q4 and 1% in Q3. The acquisition of Tripp Lite added seven points of growth. Our organic sales growth was driven by strength in industrial and residential markets overall. And as you can imagine, we're still working through supply chain constraints, which saw modest improvements in the quarter but remain challenging.
Operating margins were 19.1%, down 140 basis points from last year. And this decline was driven primarily by higher input costs and supply chain inefficiencies and also some increased growth-related investments. Importantly, we were successful in fully offsetting the expected inflationary costs with price increases on a dollar basis. However, we did not earn incremental margins on inflation, which did compress margins.
So things continue to accelerate. We had strength across all end markets with a range of up 28% to up 36%, and this led to a record backlog, which increased 86% on an organic basis. And on a sequential basis, we posted a large $1.3 billion increase in our backlog. Moving to Page 7, we have a summary of our electrical Global business, where we had another very strong quarter.
Our organic growth was 18% with 3% headwind from currency. We saw strength in all regions with particular strength in commercial and industrial markets. We also generated strong operating leverage, delivering record Q1 operating margins of 19.4% and incremental margins of 36%. Similar to Q4, this included some favorable mix from our exposure to growing industrial end markets, but we expect this to continue.
Just before we move to the industrial businesses, here's the way that I'd really summarize the performance of our combined electrical business. The business delivered strong organic growth of 14%, built a sizable backlog which strengthens certainly our outlook for future quarters, and we improved margin by 20 basis points. So on balance, I'd say, once again, a strong quarter given the current operating environment. Let's move to Page 8, where we recap our aerospace segment.
Revenues were up 3%, all organic. We continue to see solid growth in North America aftermarket business and in our South America business, which was offset by weakness in global light vehicle markets. As you've read, this market continued to experience significant supply chain constraints, which certainly impacted revenues in the quarter. Just as markets here begin to see some improvements, supply chain issues tied to primarily the war in the Ukraine had a particularly large impact on this market.
These constraints also contributed to operating inefficiencies in our business and a 50 basis point reduction in our operating margins. We're undertaking a number of price- and cost-related measures to offset the additional inflation, but it will certainly take some time to get these in place, but certainly something we plan to do before the end of the year. Turning to growth. During our investor meeting earlier this year, we provided an overview of how we're transforming the business by focusing on new spaces and products not tied to the internal combustion engine.
And so this business is performing very much like we expected. Moving to Page 10, we summarize our eMobility segment. Revenues increased 52%, including 7% organic and 46% from the acquisition of Royal Power with 1% negative currency. While still negative, we narrowed the operating loss in the quarter, and then we expect to generate positive margins for the year.
We've also increased margins for our aerospace business by 20 basis points and eMobility by 50 basis points. These three segments are offsetting the lower margins that we're now expecting in our vehicle business due to margin compression from the new wave of inflation that we experienced in the quarter and expect for the year and some inefficiencies as well in our operations. But at the midpoint, we expect to deliver record margins and to be north of 20% for the first time in Eaton's history. So on balance, a very strong year.
Turning to Page 12, we provide the balance of our guidance for the year. We're raising our '22 guidance on adjusted EPS to between $7.32 and $7.72, which is 14% growth at the midpoint and reflective of what we think is going to be a strong year. We're increasing our organic growth, as we talked about, from 9% to 11%. And this is partially offset by $250 million of negative currency compared to our original guidance, where we thought currency would be flat for the year.
So if you think about it, we're also offsetting approximately $0.10 of headwinds from negative currency in our earnings. But for the new FX headwinds, we'd certainly be taking our guidance up more than we did today. And we did complete $86 million of share repurchases in the quarter, and we're on track for a full-year guidance of $200 million to $300 million for the year. Lastly, our Q2 guidance includes adjusted EPS forecast between $1.78 and $1.88 for Q2; organic revenue growth between seven -- excuse me, 9% and 11%; negative currency, we think, will be $75 million; and 8% net revenue impact from M&A.
And despite high inflation and supply chain challenges, we're growing our margins. I would also point out that based upon our Q1 actuals and Q2 guidance, we expect to generate 46% of our full-year adjusted EPS in the first half, and this is in line with our historical averages of -- for first-half earnings. So as the global economy continues to face unprecedented number of challenges, I'd say you can count on our team to continue to execute well to deliver our commitments in both the short and the long term. So with that, I'll turn it back to Yan for Q&A.",18.0,Low
ETN,2022,2,"You'll recall that we own the Hydraulics business in all of Q2 last year. The $1.87 a share was close to the high end of our guidance range as well. We also posted an all-time record segment margins of 20.1%, up 150 basis points over prior year and above the high end of our guidance. So in addition to strong growth, our teams have done really an effective job of managing price to offset inflation.
And lastly, we're raising our full year guidance as well. We're increasing our organic growth forecast from a range of up 9% to 11% to up 11% to 13%. And we're increasing our full year adjusted EPS to $7.56 at the midpoint, 14% year-on-year growth and despite additional headwinds from FX, from higher interest expense and lower pension income. Moving to page four, we show the financial results for the quarter.
And I'll just note a few items here. First, our revenues were flat year over year, with 11% organic growth offset by the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of some 9% and 2% from negative FX. And we're certainly very pleased with this level of organic growth, but I would also note that growth could have been much better but for persistent shortages of electronic components and COVID-related lockdowns in China. Second, currency headwinds were worse than we expected in our guidance and almost $150 million impact versus prior year.
As you'll see in our forward guidance, we expect this number to get worse in the second half. The FX headwinds will also reduce our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.05 in the quarter. Lastly, I'd like to emphasize that we really did achieve a number of all-time records in the quarter, including segment operating profit, segment operating margins and adjusted EPS. Next, on page five, we have the results of our electrical Americas business, and really just a strong quarter across the board here.
As you can see, organic growth up 16% and record segment margins of 23.2%. We delivered strong growth across all end markets, with particular strength in commercial, residential and industrial markets. And organic growth actually accelerated from Q1, up some 10%, with sequential acceleration in nearly all of our markets with the biggest increases coming from utility, data centers and commercial markets. We did manage to -- through a number of fairly significant supply chain constraints but did see improvements in metals and resins and logistics, but continue to see challenges in electronic components.
Orders on a rolling 12-month basis were up 29%, with strength across all end markets with a range of anywhere from up 18% to up 39%. So we continue to be pleased with strong demand that we're seeing in our end markets and with our backlog, which increased some 89% to a new record level. On a sequential basis, our backlog growth was up almost 20% from Q1. We also delivered record operating margins of 23.2%, up 190 points, driven largely by better-than-expected volumes.
Organic growth was 12%, with 7% headwind from currency. We saw growth in all regions with particular strength in data centers, commercial and industrial markets. And orders on a rolling 12-month basis were up some 19%, while our backlog grew 38% to a new record level. We also delivered record Q2 operating profits and operating margins.
At 18.9%, operating margins were up some 60 basis points from prior year. And lastly, we recently closed a new joint venture in China by acquiring 50% of Jiangsu Huineng Electric, which manufactures and markets low-voltage circuit breakers in China for the renewable energy market. And I'd say here, this is our third electrical JV in China in the last eight months, which allows us to expand our market participation by offering what we'd say is a multi-tiered portfolio of products serving this very high-growth market, both inside and outside of China. And on a combined basis, these three JVs increase our addressable market to about -- by about $17 billion.
Next, on page eight, we summarize the performance of our vehicle segment. Revenues were up 5%, which includes 7% organic growth and 2% negative currency. We had particular strength in the North America light vehicle markets and in our South America business, which was partially offset by flat performance in Europe and weakness in China largely due to the COVID lockdowns. Operating margins were down some 260 basis points, driven primarily by margin compression from inflationary costs and the normal lag in our ability to recover price in the marketplace.
We do expect that the price inflation equation will improve in the second half, and it's reflected in our outlook for the year. Turning to page nine. We show the results of our eMobility business. Revenues increased 55%, which includes 11% organic growth, 46% from the acquisition of Royal Power and a negative 2% currency impacts.
Overall, we continue to make steady progress toward our 2030 goal, which is to create a $2 billion to $4 billion business with attractive 15% segment margins. And as we noted at our investor meeting earlier this year, we expect the segment to deliver $1.2 billion of revenues and 11% margins by 2025. Next, on slide 10, we have the updated guidance for 2022. As you can see, for the second time this year, we're increasing our organic growth guidance for all but one of our segments really based upon continued strength in all of our end markets.
We're raising our overall organic growth from 9% to 11% to 11% to 13%, on the back really of strength in our electrical segment, where we've increased growth by 300 basis points in the Americas and 150 basis points in global. For margins, we're raising our full year guidance for Eaton to be in the range of 20% to 20.4%, which represents, at the midpoint, 130 basis point improvement over 2021. The two changes in the segment include increasing margin guidance for electrical Americas by 70 basis points to 22.2% at the midpoint and lowering our margin targets for vehicle by 120 basis points to 16.5% at the midpoint. And as we talked about, the vehicle reduction really reflects the timing and margin compression associated with inflation versus price realization that we discussed earlier.
So overall, I'd say a strong first half, including robust demand in orders, record levels of backlog, and we're very well positioned for the year. Moving to page 11. We show the balance of our guidance for the year. For the second time this year, we're raising our '22 guidance for adjusted EPS, which is now forecast to be between $7.36 and $7.76 a share.
And as I covered on prior pages, we're increasing our organic growth outlook to 11% to 13%. I would note this is partially offset by $450 million of negative currency, which compares to our previous guidance of negative $250 million. The stronger dollar requires us to, in this case, offset some additional $0.08 of earnings versus our prior guidance, which we are clearly doing and is reflected in our outlook. We also expect that our corporate expenses will now be $20 million to $40 million above 2021 levels or between $580 million and $600 million.
So just wrapping up on page 12, just to recap a few points. First, I'd say we continue to realize the benefits of our active portfolio management, which is certainly showing up in our record levels of financial performance. Second, we're seeing secular trends that are enhancing our end market growth rate now, and we fully expect this to continue into the future. We've discussed growth in electrification and energy transition and digitalization for some time now.
Now, these factors obviously contribute to our confidence in our ability to raise guidance for the year. But more importantly, I'd say they really give us confidence in the long-term outlook for the company. In the short term, we're working through supply chain disruptions, focusing on controlling the things that we can control, building more resilience in our operations and delivering our commitments. So with that, I'll turn it back to Yan, and we'll open it up for Q&A.",18.0,Low
EW,2022,1,"Greetings, and welcome to the Edwards Lifesciences first quarter 2022 results conference call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Mark Wilterding, vice president of investor relations and treasurer. Thank you.
Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important safety information may be found in the press release, our 2021 annual report on Form 10-K and Edwards' other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company's website at edwards.com. Finally, a quick reminder that when using the terms underlying and adjusted, management is referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, they are referring to GAAP results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during the call are included in today's press release.
Thank you, Mark. Let me begin by saying I remain very proud of our team's steadfast dedication to our patient-focused strategy. Throughout the first quarter, our supply chain delivered and our field team continued to support the skilled clinicians and patients who count on Edwards. We continue to believe that 2022 will be an important year for Edwards Lifesciences as we expect low double-digit sales growth and meaningful progress on our pursuit of significant opportunities to improve patient care.
Turning now to our first quarter financial results. Sales of $1.3 billion increased 13% on a constant currency basis versus the year-ago period. Despite the impact that Omicron had on hospital capacity, resources and procedure volumes in January, especially in the U.S., Q1 global sales were moderately better than our expectations. Sales were lifted by performance outside the U.S., where we experienced a less pronounced impact from the pandemic.
Thanks, Mike. We are encouraged by our start to the year, despite the impact from Omicron early in the quarter, all product groups performed well, and sales were balanced across all regions. We achieved total sales in the quarter of $1.341 billion, which represents 12.7% year over year underlying growth. This strong sales performance fell through to our operating income, and we achieved adjusted earnings per share of $0.60.
Assuming no new COVID headwinds and a gradual improvement in U.S. hospital staffing shortages, we are projecting second quarter sales to be between $1.36 billion and $1.44 billion, which represents sequential organic growth from the first quarter, partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds. We expect our year-over-year sales growth in the second quarter to be our lowest of the year given our strong prior year sales performance. We are also projecting second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.61 to $0.69.
For the full year 2022, we continue to expect R&D to be 17% to 18% of sales as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT. Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 14.3% or 14.4%, excluding the impact of special items. This is slightly higher than the midpoint of our full year guidance range because it included the unplanned impact of U.S.
tax regulations published in Q1. These regulations potentially limit the amount of foreign taxes that are against U.S. income taxes. We continue to expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be 11% to 15%, including an estimated benefit of 3 percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting.
Foreign exchange rates decreased our first quarter reported sales growth by 2.5 percentage points or $27 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $170 million negative impact or about 3% to full year 2022 sales compared to 2021 versus our previous expectation of a $100 million negative impact. We forecast this additional $70 million negative impact to sales will occur over the remainder of the year. FX rates positively impacted our first quarter gross profit margin by 240 basis points compared to the prior year.
Although this benefits our operating margin rate relative to our January guidance, FX rates had a minimal impact on first quarter earnings per share. As we mentioned at the investor conference, in periods of a strengthening dollar like this, sales are negatively impacted. But as a result of financial and natural hedges, margin rates benefit, resulting in little impact to the bottom line. At current rates, our operating margin in 2022 is benefiting by approximately 200 basis points from foreign exchange.
Free cash flow for the first quarter was $221 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $294 million, less capital spending of $73 million. We continue to expect full year 2022 free cash flow will be between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion. This includes approximately $200 million of accelerated tax payments due to a change in the tax treatment of research and development expenses. Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities.
We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31, 2022. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $400 million in stock through an accelerated share repurchase agreement and pre-established 10b5-1 programs. As a result, average diluted shares outstanding during the quarter declined by approximately $3 million to $629 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2022 to be between $630 million to $635 million.
Thank you, Scott. So we're confident in our long-term outlook for strong sales growth, and our teams remain passionate about helping more patients around the world. We continue to focus on driving organic growth with leading innovative technologies, while aggressively investing in our future. Our foundation of leadership, coupled with a robust product pipeline, positions us well for continued long-term success and greater shareholder value as we pursue significant opportunities to improve patient's lives.",19.0,Low
EW,2022,2,"Greetings, and welcome to the Edwards Lifesciences' second quarter 2022 results conference call. [Operator instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Mark Wilterding, vice president, investor relations and treasurer. Thank you, sir.
These statements include, but aren't limited to, financial guidance and expectations for longer-term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation, reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as of the date on which they were made, and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update them after today. Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those associated with the pandemic that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important safety information may be found in the press release, our 2021 annual report on Form 10-K and Edwards' other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company's website at edwards.com.
Finally, a quick reminder that when using the terms underlying and adjusted, management is referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, they are referring to GAAP results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during the call are included in today's press release. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for his comments.
Thanks, Mark. In the second quarter, total company sales reflected year over year and sequential growth across all four of our product groups on a constant currency basis despite several challenging factors. Sales were lifted by a strong performance outside the U.S. with double-digit underlying sales growth in Europe and Japan.
We estimate that our competitive position was stable. Localized hospital staffing disruptions impacted second quarter results, although this headwind was less pronounced than in the U.S. 15 years after commercialization, it's encouraging to see the resilience of the TAVR programs in Europe despite the challenging backdrop of today's environment. In Japan, we experienced continued strong TAVR adoption as we remain focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy throughout the country.
Similar to last quarter, the number of TAVR procedures performed exceeded surgical aortic valve replacement following approval last year for patients at low surgical risk. In summary, we continue to be very optimistic about the long-term potential of TAVR because of its transformational impact on the many patients suffering from aortic stenosis and because many remain untreated. Recall that we had previously assumed an improvement in the U.S. hospital staffing shortages throughout the year.
We are encouraged to see global growth despite sales headwinds from the planned discontinuation of certain noncore cannula products, as well as the COVID shutdown in China, which combined reduce growth by approximately 500 basis points. Our growth continues to be driven by increased penetration of our premium RESILIA products. We've seen strong adoption of the MITRIS RESILIA valve in the U.S. since its initial launch in April.
This benefit was excluded from our adjusted earnings per share of $0.63. This reflects an accounting adjustment from assumptions regarding potential milestone payments for previous acquisition. Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 12.5% or 12.9%, excluding the impact of special items.
Due to last quarter's new regulations that potentially limit the amount of our foreign tax credits, combined with an estimated reduced tax benefit from stock-based compensation accounting, we now expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be at the high end of our previous 11% to 15% range. Foreign exchange rates decreased second quarter reported sales growth by 4.6 percentage points or $60 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $250 million negative impact or 4.5 percentage points to full year 2022 sales compared to 2021, of which approximately $170 million impacts the second half of the year. FX rates positively impacted our second quarter gross profit margin by 380 basis points compared to the prior year.
FX rates had a minimal impact on second quarter earnings per share. We mentioned at the investor conference, in periods of a strengthening dollar like this, sales are negatively impacted. But as a result of financial and natural hedges, margin rates benefit resulting in a minimal impact to the bottom line in the calendar year. Free cash flow for the second quarter was $289 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $332 million less capital spending of $43 million.
Thanks a lot, Mike. Before we open it up for questions, I'm excited to announce that Edwards is planning to hos t an Investor Update at TCT on Saturday, September 17. This event will recap -- will include a recap of pivotal trial data, updates on our latest technologies and views on longer-term market potential. We hope to see you there.",19.0,Low
GOOGL,2022,1,"Welcome, everyone, and thank you for standing by for the Alphabet first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, director of investor relations. Please go ahead.
Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations, and financial performance may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.
Beyond the U.S., we have announced new office investments in London and Warsaw and a new product development center in Nairobi. We are excited for the product development they will support. We'll share more about these investments at Google I/O, our annual developer conference on May 11, and I encourage you to tune in. Turning now to product highlights.
And in the year ahead, we will give YouTube's connected TV viewers new smartphone control navigation and interactivity features, allowing people to comment and share content they are watching on television directly from their devices. Turning next to our computing platforms. A few weeks ago, we marked a big milestone, our 100th release of Chrome and Chrome OS. Over the years, we have worked with developer and OEM partners to improve speed, simplicity, and security, and move the Web forward.
Today, 99% of developers qualify for a service fee of 15% or less. While this impacted our short-term results, we think it's the right long-term approach to support the ecosystem and to be the most developer-friendly app store and gaming platform available. We are also exploring alternative billing options. And as we do this, we'll continue to uphold high safety standards that protect personal data and sensitive financial information.
Next, on to cloud, where Q1 revenue grew 44% year over year with continued strong performance across Google Cloud Platform and Workspace. We continue to deliver differentiated products across four distinct areas; first, cybersecurity, where we introduced new offerings, including assured workloads to address digital sovereignty in the European Union; virtual machine threat detection, a first-to-market, agentless malware detection capability; an advanced intrusion detection system for network threat detection. Organizations like T-Mobile and DoorDash are protecting their critical systems and data with Google Cloud's trusted cybersecurity products. These include Security Command Center, which helps many companies, including UKG, Ultimate Kronos Group; and Ocado Group, monitor and manage their security posture and risk.
Our leading threat detection and response platform, Chronicle, is now paired with Simplified to more quickly automate incident detection and resolution. We also announced our intent to acquire Mandiant, a leader in dynamic cyber defense and response, to help protect customers from the most advanced threats. Second, we continue to evolve a leading data cloud with serverless Spark to run batch Spark workloads; BigLake, a new storage engine that unifies data warehouses and lakes; and Dataplex, which provides unified management and governance of data across data warehouses and lakes. Our unified data cloud and AI platform is helping organizations like KeyBanc, LG Electronics, and Macy's work intelligently with data across multiple clouds.
Third, our open secure infrastructure remains a differentiator as it enables customers to run their workloads and apps where they need them. This is winning global brands like Dun & Bradstreet, Boeing, and Kyocera. Our product leadership continued with the release of Tau VMs, which powers price performance that's more than 40% better than any other leading cloud; and Google Distributed Cloud Edge, a new edge solution designed to run telecommunication networks at scale, which is helping Bell Canada evolve its 5G network. And we further expanded our regional footprint globally.
In addition to our own ambitious goals to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030, we recently joined Frontier, a new coalition with Stripe and many others, jointly committing more than $900 million to accelerate carbon removal solutions. Before I close, we remain deeply concerned about the war in Ukraine and the humanitarian crisis unfolding in the region. While I was in Warsaw, Poland last month, I met with many leaders across Central and Eastern Europe to reaffirm our commitment to the region. We are finding ways for our products and platforms to be helpful, including enhanced features on Search to help refugees find resources.",24.0,Medium
GOOGL,2022,2,"Welcome, everyone, and thank you for standing by for the Alphabet Inc. second quarter 2022 earnings call. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, director of investor relations. Please go ahead.
Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our investor relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.
Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm proud of how our teams continue to build helpful products and experiences for people and partners. Reflecting this, our performance in Search in the second quarter was strong. We are also seeing momentum in Cloud.
Merchants will soon be able to submit 3D images of their products to appear directly on Google Search. So customers can try before they buy. We're also focused on bringing together hardware, software and AI in a range of helpful devices. At IO, we announced great new products, including Pixel 6A, Pixel Buds Pro and Pixel Watch.
We are making it easier for Android users to share photos and communicate with friends and family with a modern messaging standard called Rich Communication Services or RCS. Across our platforms and beyond, we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. Safe browsing on Chrome browsers help protect billions of people every day by warning them when they try to access dangerous sites or files. Earlier this year, we rolled out a new machine learning model that identifies more than twice as many potentially malicious sites and phishing attacks as the previous model, helping to contribute to a safer and more secure web.
We've also unified our password managers across Chrome and Android. Now, stored passwords can be grouped and protected across devices, apps on the web. Taking a closer look at YouTube. YouTube Shorts are watched by over 1.5 billion signed-in users every month with more than 30 billion daily views.
Third, cybersecurity. Google has always provided a secure cloud infrastructure, and we continue to introduce new cybersecurity products that help customers deduct, protect and respond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats. Customers like GitLab, Highmark Health and Iron Mountain; protect their critical systems and data with our products Caribou Coffee and Etsy are among the 5 million websites protected by our cybersecurity technology. Finally, Google Workspace's easy to use and secure communication and collaboration tools continue to be chosen by many organizations as they return to hybrid work.
Thanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. It's always great to be with you all. As Sundar indicated, we're as focused as ever on helping businesses navigate complexity and operate from a position of confidence. AI-powered tools, insights and automation are arming customers and partners with the ability to stay agile and responsive so they can capture short-term opportunities while also building for the long term.
Advertiser adoption is up five times year-to-date. Sustainable Apparel brand, Rothy's drove a 59% increase in conversions and a 60% increase in revenue after turning to P-Max. By leveraging its creative assets and showing them at scale, Rothy's reached more customers in a way they hadn't been able to do before. Innovating across Search and YouTube also remain top priorities.
Sundar mentioned new 3D AR features. Target and Wayfair are testing these to help customers see and shop products in real life. We launched new ad formats for more visual, browsey search experiences. And then, there's cool live commerce capabilities like live direct which let creators start a shopping live stream on their channel and then redirect viewers to a brand's channel for more.
Second, as Sundar said, our momentum in Shorts continues. Last quarter, we shared that we're in the early stages of testing monetization with ads, and we continue to be encouraged by the results so far. Third, there's full funnel, which we've covered before, and more advertisers are embracing. On average, YouTube advertisers using a full funnel strategy experienced 80% unique reach across brand and action campaigns.
Net income was $16 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $12.6 billion in the quarter and $65 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $125 billion in cash and marketable securities. Let me now turn to our segment financial results.
We also saw a slowdown in buyer spend due to a number of factors, including lower engagement levels compared with earlier stages of the pandemic. In terms of costs within Google Services, TAC was $12.2 billion, up 12%. Google Services operating income was $22.8 billion, up 2%, and the operating margin was 36%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment.
Revenues were $6.3 billion for the second quarter, up 36%. GCP's revenue growth was again greater than Cloud's, reflecting significant growth in both infrastructure and platform services. Strong revenue growth in Google Workspace was driven by solid growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $858 million.
As to our other bets for the second quarter, revenues were $193 million and the operating loss was $1.7 billion. Let me close with some comments on our outlook. In terms of the Google Services segment. We are pleased with our performance in Search in the second quarter, which continued to deliver strong results.
As a reminder, the 2022 revenue growth rates are presented against particularly tough comps as we lapped the recovery in the second quarter of 2021 from the impact of the pandemic in early 2020. Going forward, the very strong revenue performance last year continues to create tough comps that will weigh on year-on-year growth rates of advertising revenues for the remainder of the year. In YouTube and Network, the pullbacks in spend by some advertisers in the second quarter reflects uncertainty about a number of factors that are challenging to disaggregate. Within other revenues in the third quarter, we expect an ongoing headwind from the fee changes and the slowdown in buyer spend that impacted results in the second quarter.
dollar strengthened versus last year from a significant tailwind last year to a 3.7 percentage point headwind in 2Q. Looking to the third quarter, based on strengthening of the U.S. dollar quarter-to-date, we expect an even larger headwind from foreign exchange. As a reminder, all segment revenues are reported on a GAAP basis.
Given the uncertain global economic outlook and the hiring progress achieved to date, as Sundar previously announced, we intend to slow the pace of hiring. We expect our actions on hiring to become more apparent in 2023. Our headcount additions in the third quarter will reflect we already have a strong number of commitments, including new graduate hires. As a reminder, we also expect the acquisition of Mandiant to close by the end of the year, which will further increase head count on top of hiring.",24.0,Medium
GOOGL,2022,3,"Welcome, everyone, and thank you for standing by for the Alphabet, Inc. third quarter 2022 earnings call. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, director of investor relations. Please go ahead.
Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC as updated in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, expected to be filed with the SEC later today. During this call, we'll present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.
Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Our financial results for the third quarter reflect healthy fundamental growth in Search and momentum in Cloud. Our reported results reflect the effect of foreign exchange. The growth in our advertising revenues was also impacted by lapping last year's elevated growth levels and the challenging macro climate.
We are sharpening our focus on a clear set of product and business priorities. The product announcements we have made in just the past month alone have shown that very clearly, including significant improvements to Search powered by AI, new ways to monetize YouTube Shorts, which will support the creator ecosystem, the strong series of hardware launches and a new partnership and product announcements at Cloud Next. These will all drive value for users, partners and our business. We have also started our work to drive efficiency by realigning resources to invest in our biggest growth opportunities.
Over the past quarter, we have made several shifts away from lower priority efforts to fuel higher growth priorities. Our Q4 headcount additions will be significantly lower than Q3. And as we plan for 2023, we'll continue to make important trade-offs where needed and are focused on moderating operating expense growth. Throughout Google's history, periods of dedicated focus have enabled us to emerge strongly and unleash new areas of computing innovation.
Android 13 offers new personalization features, improved privacy controls and a more seamless experience with connected devices. Next, Google Cloud. We see continued momentum with Q3 revenue of $6.9 billion with Google Cloud Platform's revenue growth rate above the aggregate. I've long shared that cloud is a key priority for the company.
I'm proud to share that Google Workspace is now used by more than 8 million businesses and organizations worldwide. That includes Korean Air, as well as the U.S. Army, which is transitioning 250,000 personnel to our secure communication and collaboration platform. In the past year, we have announced nearly 300 new capabilities to support hybrid work.
Empowering a distributed workforce brings an increased need for cybersecurity to keep workers' data and critical business systems safe and secure. It's top of mind for nearly every CEO I speak with, and customers, including the City of Los Angeles, Roche and Banorte put their trust in Google Cloud's industry-leading products, our new Chronicle Security Operation Suite, Unify Security Analytics, Automation Response and Threat Intelligence. This has helped Vertiv analyze 22 times more security data while cutting investigation time in half. In September, we closed our acquisition of Mandiant and are proud to welcome more than 2,600 colleagues to Google.
With Mandiant, we add industry-leading threat intelligence and incident response capabilities to help customers stay protected at every stage of the security life cycle. Customers partner with Google Cloud because we offer a single platform that can analyze data across any cloud. Our leadership here is winning customers across industries, including the state of Hawaii and the Australia Securities Exchange. Our capabilities help solve difficult business challenges like supply chain and logistics while also creating new growth opportunities.
To close, times like this are clarifying. As we head into 2023, we are going to focus on our most important priorities as a company. To support our growth, we'll continue to invest responsibly for the long term in a way that is responsive to the current economic environment. I want to thank our employees around the world for their contributions over the last quarter.
Thanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. It's great to be joining you all today. Google Services revenues of $61 billion were up 2% year on year, negatively affected by a sizable foreign exchange headwind. Search and other revenues grew 4% year over year to $40 billion, led by travel and retail, while both YouTube Ads and Network had modest year-over-year revenue declines.
On the second quarter earnings call, we noted a pullback in spend by some advertisers in YouTube and Network, and these pullbacks in spend increased in the third quarter. In Search and Other, the largest factor in the deceleration in Q3 was lapping the outsized performance in 2021. In the third quarter, we did see a pullback in spend by some advertisers in certain areas and search ads. For example, in financial services, we saw a pullback in the insurance, loan, mortgage and crypto subcategories.
There's no question we're operating in an uncertain environment, and that businesses big and small continue to get tested in new and different ways, depending on where they are in the world. When it comes to how we're helping, our focus remains unchanged. The same AI driving breakthroughs in everything from protein folding, flood forecasting and language understanding is also fueling innovation across our Ads product. Via insights, automation and easier-to-use advertising tools and formats, we're helping businesses stay agile, build resilience, anticipate the future and show up for customers in more connected, visual and consistent ways.
As festivals and events returned to summer, REVOLVE used lower funnel solutions across search and shopping to engage with consumers in high-demand apparel categories, helping it cross $1 billion in trailing 12-month net sales for the first time. And then there's Magazine Luiza, a large Brazilian retailer, who embraced omnichannel by measuring and bidding directly to store sales. Coupled with in-store pickup and notations via PMAX, Magazine Luiza drove a 38% ROAS over 30 days and has since expanded the strategy to all eligible products, including 8 million-plus new offers. And whether shoppers know exactly what they're looking for or are just seeking inspiration, we're innovating to make it easier and more engaging for people to shop online across our services.
Like in September, when Kylie and Kris Jenner hosted an exclusive shopping stream event to celebrate the debut of a new Kris collection for Kylie Cosmetics. And at Adweek last week, not only did we announce that product feeds are coming to Discovery, but that creators will soon be able to take products from brands across their videos, Shorts and live streams. This means viewers can shop products seamlessly while they watch their favorite content, while merchants can drive incremental reach and engagement for free listing offers when tagged by creators that viewers love and trust. I already touched on YouTube's performance in the quarter.
Brands continue to take notice. Like Instacart, who tapped into CTV to maximize its TV screen strategy for its The World is Your Cart brand campaign featuring Lizzo. It drove breakout searches for its product and above-average brand lift across awareness, consideration and purchase intent. And it also engaged a significant increase in audience on top of TV with 66% lower CPMs.
Our success is only possible when our customers and partners succeed. Whether it's helping individual YouTube creators or Play developers make a living and build thriving businesses or bringing the best across Google to our partners, our focus on driving growth for our partners and key ecosystems remain steadfast. I'm proud that over the past three years, we've paid creators, artists and media companies over $50 billion. In terms of how we're helping our partners innovate, I'll share two highlights.
First, a transformative partnership with Transion, the No. 1 OEM in Africa and Pakistan, will help to close the digital divide by doubling annual activations by 2025 and build helpful products for the next billion users. And then in commerce with FEMSA Digital in Mexico, we're bringing together solutions across Ads, Cloud, Maps, Waze and beyond to bolster its data and analytics capabilities so it can better reach and retain its beverage and retail customers. On behalf of many, a massive thank you to our customers and partners for their collaboration, trust and feedback and another massive thank you to our sales, partnerships, product, engineering and support teams.
We delivered free cash flow of $16.1 billion in the quarter and $63 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $116 billion in cash and marketable securities. Let me now turn to our segment financial results. As a reminder, we provide fixed foreign exchange revenues only at the consolidated level and by geographic region.
Google Cloud had an operating loss of $699 million. As to our Other Bets for the third quarter, revenues were $209 million and the operating loss was $1.6 billion. Let me close with some comments on our outlook. Our results in the third quarter reflect an increased headwind from foreign exchange, given the ongoing strengthening of the U.S.
dollar versus last year. Excluding the revenue benefit from hedging, there was a six-point headwind year on year or five points with the hedge benefit compared with a slight tailwind in the third quarter of 2021. Looking to the fourth quarter, based on strengthening of the U.S. dollar quarter to date, we expect an even larger headwind from foreign exchange.
In addition, as we have previously said, the impact of foreign exchange is greater on operating income than it is on revenues, given that our expense base is weighted more toward the U.S. with most of our R&D efforts located here. Turning to our segment results. Within the Google Services segment, Search and other revenues had healthy fundamental growth in the third quarter, which was affected by the impact of currency movements.
Customers globally are adopting our products and services to digitally transform their businesses. We are excited about the opportunity, given that businesses and governments are still in the early days of public cloud adoption and we continue to invest accordingly. We remain focused on the longer-term path to profitability. In terms of profitability, we have an effort underway to ensure we redeploy investments against our most compelling opportunities.",24.0,Medium
GOOGL,2022,4,"Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC, including our upcoming Form 10-K filing for the year ended December 31, 2022. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our investor relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.
And there are many opportunities to build on our progress at YouTube over the years, starting with Shorts monetization. Overall, I see this as an important journey to reengineer the company's cost base in a durable way. There are several dimensions already underway, including prioritization of our product investments across Google and Other Bets. It also includes a careful focus on our hiring needs, reflecting these priorities, as well as efficiencies in our technical infrastructure and productivity improvements from our AI tools.
Our reliability advantages and open edge cloud-powered mission-critical 5G network of Telefonica Germany. As I mentioned, our suite of AI/ML solutions across verticals are a key differentiator. We helped Wells Fargo automate the customer service experience for mobile users and help to continually improve the quality of patient care. In 2022, Mandiant, which we are now integrating, helped over 1,800 customers prepare for or recover from the most critical cybersecurity incidents.
In Workspace, the innovations mentioned earlier are helping drive new wins and expansions across geographies. In Other Bets, from Calico to Weibo, we are focused on investing sustainably across the portfolio and creating good business. Verily, for example, has recently honed its strategy and structure to more clearly focus its product development. To close, we are all standing on the cusp of an era of amazing opportunities.
Google Services revenues of $68 billion were down 2% year on year, negatively affected by sizable foreign exchange headwind. In Google advertising, Search and Other revenues were down 2% year over year, and YouTube Ads and Network had high single-digit revenue declines. Google Other revenues were up 8% year over year, with strong growth in YouTube, non-advertising and hardware revenues, offset by a decrease in Play revenues. I'll highlight two other factors that affected our Ads business in Q4.
In 2022, AI advances boosted bidding performance, allowing us to move advertiser outcomes down the funnel to drive better ROI and use budgets more efficiently. In search query matching, large language models like MUM matched advertiser office to user quarries. This understanding of human intent of language, combined with advances in bidding prediction, are why business can see an average of 35% more conversions when they upgrade exact match keywords to broad match in campaigns that use a target CPA. Google AI also underlies our creative products like tech suggestions in Google ads and creative optimization and responsive search ads.
In 2022, we saw an uptick in merchants, particularly SMBs and product inventory coming on to Google, adding more value for merchants remains a top priority. Third, to drive retail performance further, we focus on great ads products from automation and insights to bidding tools and omnichannel solutions to AI-powered campaigns like PMax, we're helping retailers hit their goals and connect with customers no matter where or when they shop. Two quick insights on PMax, which we upgraded the majority of advertisers to from smart shopping campaigns last year. First, advertisers on average see a 12% uplift from SSE to PMax.
Operating income was $18.2 billion, down 17% versus last year, and our operating margin was 24%. Net income was $13.6 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $16 billion in the fourth quarter and $60 billion in 2022. We ended the year with $114 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Offsetting growth in these two areas was a year-on-year decline in Play revenues, reflecting a particularly large foreign exchange headwind in APAC, as well as the impact of reductions of Play Store fees. TAC was $12.9 billion, down 4%. Google Services operating income was $21.1 billion, down 19%, and the operating margin was 31%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment.
Google Cloud had an operating loss of $480 million. As to our Other Bets, for the full year 2022, revenues were $1.1 billion and the operating loss was $6.1 billion. Turning to our outlook for the business. In 2022, our year-on-year revenue growth was affected by a number of challenges.
First, we faced very tough comps, given the outsized recovery in 2021 from the impact of the pandemic. Second, foreign exchange headwinds grew throughout the year. And third, we were operating against the backdrop of a more challenging economic climate that also impacted many of our customers and which remains ongoing. Within Google Services, we are focused on investing in the opportunities we see for long-term revenue growth.
With YouTube subscriptions, we're optimistic about building on its momentum across YouTube Music Premium, YouTube TV, and Primetime Channels. In hardware, we continue to make sizable investments particularly to support innovation across our Pixel family while working to drive greater focus and cost efficiencies across the portfolio. For Google Cloud, we remain excited about the long-term market opportunity and the trajectory of the business. Enterprises and governments are increasingly turning to us for their digital transformation initiatives across verticals and geographies.
While investing for growth, we remain very focused on Google Cloud's path to profitability. In terms of Other Bets, as Sundar mentioned, we will be making a financial reporting change as it relates to DeepMind. To reflect the increasing DeepMind collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets, beginning in the first quarter, DeepMind will no longer be reported in Other Bets and will be reported as part of Alphabet's corporate costs. I'll now walk you through the key elements of our efforts to deliver a durable reengineering of our cost base in order to slow the pace of operating expense growth.
We expect the impact will become more visible in 2024. First, with respect to Alphabet headcount, we are meaningfully slowing the pace of hiring in 2023 while still investing in priority areas. In Q4, we added 3,455 people. As in prior quarters, the majority of hires were for technical roles.
With respect to our recent announcement that we are reducing our workforce by approximately 12,000 roles, most of the impact will be seen in Q1. We will take a severance charge of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion, which will be reported in corporate costs. We will continue hiring in priority areas with a particular focus on top engineering and technical talent, as well as on the global footprint of our talent. Second, we have a longer-term effort underway to reengineer our cost base in three broad categories: first, using AI and automation to improve productivity across Alphabet for operational tasks, as well as the efficiency of our technical infrastructure; second, managing our spend with suppliers and vendors more effectively; and third, optimizing how and where we work.",24.0,Medium
HAL,2022,1,"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Halliburton's first quarter 2022 earnings call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Coleman, head of investor relations. Please go ahead, sir.
These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual financial results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures.
Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased with Halliburton's first quarter results. Our performance demonstrates the resilience of our unique strategy in action and the importance of our competitive positioning, both in North America and international markets. Here are some highlights from the first quarter.
This brings the total number of program participants and alumni to 15 companies. Halliburton Labs allows us to actively participate in the future of clean energy value chains. Finally, we retired $600 million of our $1 billion of debt maturing in 2025 and nearly tripled our quarterly dividend to $0.12 per share. These actions strengthen our balance sheet and reflect our commitment to return cash to shareholders.
Before we continue, I want to provide a few comments about the current situation in Ukraine and Russia. This is a tragedy on many dimensions and for us especially for our people in both countries. As we've all seen, governments in the European Union, the United States, Switzerland, and other countries swiftly enacted far-reaching sanctions on new investment and export controls on goods, supplies, and technologies to Russia. In compliance with sanctions and consistent with our strategy for profitable international growth, we announced that we would begin steps toward a wind-down of our Russian operations, and we remain active in that process.
We expect oil and gas demand will grow over the near and medium-term driven by economic expansion, energy security concerns, and population growth. At the same time, supply remains under the structural threat of scarcity. While the war in Ukraine has created a short-term dislocation in commodity markets, the fundamental supply tightness existed before this geopolitical conflict. Current oil supply, tightness, and commodity price levels strengthen my confidence in the accelerating multi-year upcycle and very busy years ahead for Halliburton.  In addition, I expect an important change in our customers' behavior and priorities will provide structural support to oil prices throughout this upcycle.
I believe supply dynamics have fundamentally changed due to investor return requirements, public ESG commitments, and regulatory pressure, which make it more difficult for operators to commit to long cycle hydrocarbon investments and instead drive investment flexibility through short cycle barrels. The pursuit of increased investment flexibility leads operators to prioritize short-cycle projects, development over exploration, tiebacks versus new infrastructure, and shale rather than deepwater. Clearly, there are important exceptions where successful long-term projects will be developed, but painting with a broad brush, I believe most investments will be directed primarily toward short cycle activity in the near and medium-term. The result of this focus is an industrywide increase in the level of investment flexibility for operators and the subsequent support to commodity prices.
With short cycle barrels, companies make investment decisions annually and can respond more quickly to commodity price signals. As a result, when investment stops, production at a minimum doesn't grow. And in the case of unconventionals, it quickly declines. For example, when the pandemic drove the collapse of oil demand two years ago, US shale companies swiftly reduced activity and production declined by 2 million barrels in nine months.
In contrast, long cycle projects have two key elements a long time horizon and a large upfront capital investment. Once these projects begin, investment continues and production cannot quickly respond to price signals. This tends to result in market oversupply. The pivot to short cycle barrels creates the opposite effect a perpetual threat of undersupply that is supportive of the commodity price.
I believe this pivot to short cycle barrels is great for Halliburton and sets up fantastic conditions for us to outperform. Short cycle activity results in higher relative capital spending by operators aimed directly at the wellbore for services Halliburton provides, as opposed to infrastructure investments required for long-cycle projects. Our strong technology portfolio and market footprint match this activity globally. Halliburton works, innovates, and invests where it matters most for our customers.
And finally, Halliburton's value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers explicitly focuses on helping operators maximize returns and cash flow. This makes Halliburton uniquely relevant to this environment. Our five strategic priorities are clear and effective and will drive our behavior in this upcycle. First, we focus on profitable growth and our strong international franchise.
Second, our completion to order book increased 50% year on year in the first quarter, which represents work generally delivered within the current year. And third, we have a strong pipeline of new projects scheduled to start in the second half of this year, particularly in the Middle East. We expect international activity to gain momentum in the second quarter, led by the Middle East and Latin America, and further accelerate in the second half of the year. More importantly, our strong first quarter drilling and evaluation division margins demonstrate our focus on profitable international growth.
We enter this upcycle with the best product portfolio in our history, and we see increased customer demand for our high-end technology and a recognition of its value. For example, Halliburton recently deployed our new Strata examiners wireline imaging service for multiple customers in Norway and Morocco. Strata examiners helped operators acquire more accurate well data in oil and synthetic-based muds, better evaluate production potential, and save rig time with log-down capability and increased logging speed. Another example is the latest addition to our logging while drilling suite, the StrataStar azimuthal resistivity service for thin enter bedded formations.
Similar to our premium EarthStar service, the StrataStar combines high-fidelity downhole sensors with powerful digital inversion capabilities. Multiple customers in the Middle East, Latin America, US, and Canada use it for faster, more accurate reservoir characterization to precisely place wells in the most productive zones and maximize asset value. We also see a slight uptick in offshore exploration activity, albeit from a historically low base. Halliburton's increased competitiveness in drilling and evaluation resulted in a doubling of our contract win rate in global exploration work over the last two years, and we expect to benefit from any additional growth in this higher margin market different from prior cycles.
This quarter it will start manufacturing products for our production chemicals contract with a large IOC in Oman and chemicals for our own product service lines. Several years ago, I described digitalization as one of the defining trends in our industry for this decade. Today, digital innovations permeate all segments of the oilfield services market. At Halliburton, our strategy to drive digital and automation creates technological differentiation, contributes to higher international margins, and drives internal efficiencies and cost savings.
On an integrated project in the Middle East, we combine data science, smart bits, drilling automation, and project management services for a more than 40% reduction in average well delivery time. We also deploy our digital solutions to advance a sustainable energy future. In the first quarter, energy entered Halliburton to assess the carbon storage potential of the Prinos basin in Greece. We will use our decision space 365 cloud applications to perform long-term plume modeling, characterize the storage complex and create a conceptual development plan with performance modeling.
We expect to deliver steady, profitable growth in the international markets for the rest of this year. Increased activity and equipment tightness continues to sharpen our pricing discussions with customers. Pricing is increasing on current contract extensions. In the first quarter, the percentage of contract extensions exercised almost doubled compared to the same period last year, as operators generally prefer to extend existing contracts rather than bid work in an inflationary market.
Pricing is also increasing on newer. Turning to North America, we see market tightness across all service segments. In the first quarter, the average US rig count increased 14% sequentially and is up 62% year on year. Additionally, frac activity surged in March after winter weather, and supply chain disruptions occurred earlier in the quarter.
For example, our sophisticated supply chain organization responded by sourcing sand from Wisconsin when local mines were down in the Permian. In trucking, our collaboration with Vorto provides us with real-time information on the market-clearing price for drivers, and allows us to manage inflation, and significantly reduces logistics-related nonproductive time. Years of low pricing and low returns impacted the North American oilfield services sector and the larger supply chain that supports our industry. Sustainably improved pricing is required to avoid future supply chain disruptions and to invest in the equipment, people, and technology necessary to deliver production growth.
I believe our customers understand this. Against this backdrop, we see a long runway for ongoing net pricing improvement across all of our product service lines in this recovery. Halliburton is focused on maximizing value in North America for us. This is a margin cycle, not a build cycle.
Our corporate and other expenses for the quarter totaled $57 million, and I expect that to serve as a good quarterly run rate for the remainder of the year. Net interest expense for the quarter was $107 million. I expect this level of interest expense to drift slightly lower in the second quarter as a result of a full quarter impact of our reduced debt balance. Our normalized effective tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 21%.
Our first quarter cash flow from operations and free cash flow were a use of cash of $50 million and $183 million, respectively. These results were primarily driven by investment in working capital, consistent with our strong activity growth. As is typical for our business in an upcycle, we expect our cash flow to be back-end loaded for the year. We still expect to generate strong free cash flow for the remainder of 2022.
Thanks, Lance. Let me summarize what we've talked about today. We believe that this accelerating multi-year upcycle is different and more sustainable than prior cycles due to operators' focus on short-cycle barrels. Halliburton's strategic priorities are clear and effective and drive outperformance.",24.0,Medium
HAL,2022,2,"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to Halliburton's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to David Coleman, head of investor relations.
These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. Recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings.  We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.
I am pleased with the strong performance Halliburton delivered in the first half of this year, and I thank all Halliburton employees for their hard work and contribution to these outstanding results and dedication to superior service quality. Before we discuss our execution in the International and North American markets, let me address recent market volatility. In the second quarter, central banks took action in an attempt to control inflation, raising concerns about a potential economic slowdown. Despite this near-term volatility, I believe the oil and gas market fundamentals still strongly support a multi-year energy upcycle.
From a demand perspective, oil and gas remain a critical component of long-term economic growth. Post-Pandemic economic expansion, energy security requirements, and population growth will continue to drive demand. Today, the oil and gas supply is tight, despite an environment needed by ongoing China lockdowns, and jet fuel demand is below historical norms. Meaningful supply solutions will take time, OPEC spare capacity is at historic lows, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve release is unsustainable, and the risk to Russia's supply remains high.
On the industry side. Despite high commodity prices, operators remain disciplined because of investor return requirements, public ESG commitments, and regulatory pressure. In response, service companies invested for returns and did not overbuild. In short, this cycle has been nothing like prior cycles.
This means any economic slowdown will not solve the structural oil undersupply problem. At Halliburton, the steps we took to improve operating leverage, lower capital intensity, and strengthen our balance sheet best equip us to outperform under any market conditions. Here's why we believe that. First, we use the pandemic to redesign the cost profile of our business, we structurally removed over $1 billion of costs.
This lower capital profile is key to our strong free cash flow generation. Finally, we prioritized strengthening our balance sheet and retired $1.8 billion of debt since the beginning of 2020. This reduced our cash interest expense and put us within striking distance of our leverage targets. Now let's turn to our second quarter performance and expectations for the rest of 2022.
We greatly increased our drilling competitiveness. We are present in all the markets that matter and we have unique growth opportunities in the production space. Let me elaborate. The activity mix in this upcycle is different from prior cycles.
Today, operators focus more on developing known resources and less on long-term exploration programs, this means drilling more wellbores. The products and services customers require for drilling more wellbores benefit Halliburton. For example, and one of the largest international offshore markets. Over 60% of a typical wells service cost goes to drilling fluids, cementing, and completion hardware.
This means more operators spend on services where Halliburton has a leading position. Baroid, our drilling and completion fluids business entered this cycle as the leading fluids provider globally. During the downturn, we brought the chemical supply chain closer to our international customers and localized our workforce. This improved our cost, competitiveness, and margins.
We already completed over 70, cementing jobs using the system in the North Sea, delivering safer operations, improved service quality, and cost efficiency. Well-completion tools constitute a larger portion of wealth services spent internationally than in North America, and they are high-tech and high value add products and services. Halliburton is a global leader in completions technology, especially in advanced completions that include sand control solutions, multilateral wells, and intelligent completions. With over 20 years of multilateral installation experience globally, Halliburton is the market leader in multilateral, a key technical component in many development wells.
They help operators increase reservoir drainage in mature fields, address limited subsidy infrastructure and reduce environmental impact. Over the past few years, we strengthened our completion tools product service line in Singapore, which is closer to our international customer base and supply chain sources. With our world-class manufacturing facilities, strong local technical support, and continuous innovation. Halliburton completion tools positioned us to outperform in the international upcycle.
Geographic presence is very important in the international markets. And today we are present everywhere that matters, which is different from prior cycles. We expect to benefit from our established footprint, geographic presence, and customer and supplier relationships as international markets grow. Finally, I want to highlight the international growth opportunity.
Upon completion of trials at the end of the year, we expect pre-qualification to participate in Saudi Aramco's future artificial lift tenders. Latin America is another successful market for our artificial lift business where we operate in all significant land markets and just installed our 500th ESP in Ecuador. Our new chemical reaction plant in Saudi Arabia makes the first batch of chemicals last month and is on track to meet its ramp-up goals. This year, we expect the plant to manufacture products for our production chemicals contract with a large IOC in Oman and chemicals for our drilling fluids, specialty chemicals, and hydraulic fracturing product service lines.
Our strategic priority is to maximize value in North America by focusing on cash flow and returns, not market share. The second quarter saw another step up in both US land rig activity and stages completed with the first quarter sand supply interruptions resolved, and frac activity steadily increased throughout the quarter. As we look at the second half of 2022, Halliburton remains sold out. As for the overall market, I believe it will be all but sold out for the second half of the year due to service company discipline, long lead times for the new fleet, and supply chain bottlenecks for consumables.
We expect public companies will steadily execute their drilling and completion programs. Private E&Ps capitalize on available rigs and equipment in the first half of the year and will likely maintain a measured level of activity growth for the rest of the year. We continue to believe that North American operators' spending growth will eclipse 35% this year. Our customer conversations have already pivoted to 2023 plans well in advance of the typical timeframe.
These conversations make it clear that equipment capacity for 2023 is tight. Today we see a services market in North America that is almost unrecognizable from prior cycles or even a handful of years ago. I believe that the returns focus we now see in the services market is not a temporary phenomenon. The largest more publicly traded pressure-pumping companies now account for about two-thirds of the market.
Finally, we have global capabilities in managing supply chain and labor complexities that we believe give us a distinct competitive advantage over domestic service providers. To conclude in North America, I expect Halliburton to uniquely maximize value in the strong, steadily growing, and all but sold-out market. Globally, supply chain and labor shortages are front and center for many industries, as the post-pandemic recovery stressed both raw materials, supply, and transportation logistics. I believe Halliburton manages these shortages better than its competitors.
Our global business development, supply chain, and technology organizations closely monitor market trends and work to mitigate cost impacts through economies of scale and global procurement, technology modifications, and efficient sourcing practices. For example, as chemical costs increase, we work with our customers to adjust our pricing for cost inflation. Operators appreciate that these price adjustments are required for us to continue delivering our services. Most customers expect and accept these adjustments.
This allows us to secure talent from states out of the white-hot labor markets in traditional oil and gas basins. At the same time, our voluntary attrition numbers remain stable, both globally and in the US. This demonstrates that once we attract the right talent, we provide them with the right incentives and growth opportunities. Turning now to pricing dynamics that we see playing out in North America and internationally.
The market remains all but sold out. Supply chain bottlenecks, even for the diesel fleet, make it almost impossible to add incremental capacity this year. Halliburton has the additional advantage that our fleet primarily competes at the higher end of the pricing spectrum. Our portfolio of low emissions equipment commands premium prices, and our customers see value in the efficiency and emissions profile we provide.
Only about one-third of our work reprice every year. This means that margin and pricing inflections internationally will always materialize at a slower pace than in North America. We see evidence of customer urgency indicated by customer preference to pursue direct negotiations for contract extensions. Efficiency gains over the last several years have all accrued directly to operators, and there is still a great deal of room in customers' economics for service providers to earn a fair and durable return.
Though it often goes on, said a robust and investible service industry is a key enabler of our customers' ability to grow and maintain production. To address the world's energy needs. I'm thrilled with Halliburton's performance in the second quarter and our immediate and long-term opportunities. Our team is executing well on near-term tactical objectives, and the long-term strategic priorities provide real, tangible value for Halliburton and our shareholders.
Halliburton's competitive position is unique among our peers. We have the scale and technology to benefit meaningfully and differentially from the international market expansion, and we are the leader in the strong, steadily growing, and all but sold-out North American market. I could not be more excited about the future of Halliburton. Now, I will turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our second quarter financial results.
Higher equipment utilization and net pricing gains supported these strong results. In the second quarter, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $344 million. As a result of our decision to exit Russia due to sanctions. Now let me take a moment to discuss our division results in more detail.
All regions experienced a seasonal decline in software sales. In the second quarter, our corporate and other expense was $67 million, which was higher than expected due to the timing of employee incentives for the third quarter. We expect our corporate expenses to be slightly lower. Net interest expense for the quarter was $101 million and should remain about flat for the third quarter.
Other net expense for the quarter was $42 million, primarily related to currency losses driven by the strength of the US dollar. For the third quarter, we expect this expense to remain about flat. Our normalized effective tax rate for the second quarter came in at approximately 22%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our third quarter effective tax rate to be slightly higher.
Capital expenditure for the quarter was $221 million and will steadily increase for the remainder of the year. For the full year, we expect our capex to remain at 5% to 6% of revenue. Turning to cash flow, we generated $376 million of cash from the operation and $215 million of free cash flow during the second quarter. Working capital investments grew to support 18% sequential revenue growth.
As is typical for a business in an upcycle, we anticipate free cash flow for the year to be back-end loaded and expect to generate free cash flow at or above last year's level. Now let me turn to our near-term outlook. In the completion and production division. We expect third quarter revenue to grow in the mid-single digits and margins to improve 75 to 125 basis points.
Internationally, Halliburton is a much stronger competitor, and we expect to benefit more from this multi-year upcycle than ever before. This aligns perfectly with our strategy to deliver profitable international growth. In North America, I expect Halliburton to uniquely maximize value in this strong, steadily growing, and all but sold-out market. We will continue to execute on our strategic priorities and remain committed to driving profitable growth, margin expansion, strong free cash flow, and returns for our shareholders as this multi-year upcycle unfolds.",24.0,Medium
HAL,2022,3,"Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Halliburton's third quarter 2022 earnings call. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Coleman, senior director of investor relations.
These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures.
Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Our outlook today is strong. Oil and gas supply remains tight for the foreseeable future. International market activity is accelerating and North America service capacity continues to further tighten.
International revenue grew 3% sequentially with improved activity in the Middle East and Latin America that more than offset the revenue decline related to exiting our Russia business. Importantly, during the third quarter, we generated similar incremental margins in both international and North America markets. Finally, we generated free cash flow of $543 million and retired $600 million of debt during the quarter. I am pleased with the third quarter results.
I want to express my appreciation to the men and women of Halliburton whose hard work and dedication made these results possible. Your commitment to collaboration, safety and service quality every day make Halliburton successful. Turning to our macro outlook. Oil and gas supply remains fundamentally tight due to multiple years of underinvestment.
This tightness is apparent in historically low inventory levels, production levels well below expectations and temporary actions such as the largest ever SPR release. Against tight supply, demand for oil and gas is strong, and we believe it will remain so. While broader market volatility is clear, what we see in our business is strong and growing demand for equipment and services. There is no immediate solution to balance the world's demand for secure and reliable oil and gas against its limited supply.
I believe that only multiple years of increased investment in existing and new sources of production will solve the short supply. The effective solution to short supply is conventional and unconventional, deepwater and shallow water, new and existing developments and short and long-cycle barrels. All of it. I expect progress toward increased supply will be measured in years, not months, as behavior of both operators and service companies have changed.
Operators remain disciplined. Their commitments to investor returns require a measured approach to growth and investment. Service companies follow the same discipline, delivering on their commitments to investor returns and taking a measured approach to growth and investment. What I think is underappreciated is how this results in more sustainable growth and returns over a longer period of time.
We achieved this through improved pricing, partnering with high-quality customers and differentiated technology. Our revenue grew 9% sequentially and is up 63% over the third quarter last year. Pricing continues to improve across all product lines and completions equipment remains extremely tight across the market. Interest in e-fleets is strong and customers are pleased with the superior efficiencies, operational uptime and reduced carbon footprint of our market-leading solution.
Market consolidation, competitors that answer to public investors, disciplined customers and supply chain constraints all drive the services market that I expect to remain tight for the foreseeable future. Halliburton will continue to outperform in this market. Our best-in-class Zeus e-fleets have pumped over 20,000 hours for customers. Our e-fleet customers know that they have a field-proven technology which carries the full weight of Halliburton's expertise to build, run and optimize this next-generation equipment.
Execution is at the heart of Halliburton's identity. We collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. You've seen that in action in today's results. You can hear how excited I am about Halliburton's future all around the world.
In our drilling and evaluation division, revenue in the third quarter was $2.2 billion, an increase of 3% when compared to the second quarter while operating income was $325 million, an increase of 14% when compared to the second quarter. These results were driven by improved drilling-related services in Latin America and Middle East Asia and increased project management and wireline services internationally. The exit from our Russia business negatively impacted financial results for both divisions. Moving on to geographic results.
For the fourth quarter, we expect our corporate expense to be up slightly or roughly in line with second quarter. Net interest expense for the quarter was $93 million, a slight decrease due to higher yields on cash balances. For the fourth quarter, we expect this expense to decrease slightly due to lower debt balances. Other net expense for the quarter was $48 million, primarily related to currency losses driven by the strength of the U.S.
dollar. For the fourth quarter, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat. Our normalized effective tax rate for the third quarter came in at approximately 22%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our fourth quarter effective tax rate to increase slightly.
We expect full year free cash flow to be in the range of last year's free cash flow. With the latest payment of $600 million, we have now retired $2.4 billion of debt since 2020. We're quickly approaching our near-term leverage target of two times gross debt-to-EBITDA. Given our balance sheet position and strong outlook, we now have greater flexibility to increase the cash we'll return to shareholders through dividends and/or share buybacks under our existing repurchase program.
Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Halliburton's third quarter financial performance shows our strategy in action, delivering value for our shareholders. Oil and gas supply remains tight, requiring multiple years of investment.",24.0,Medium
HAL,2022,4,"These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2021, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30th, 2022, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly update any forward-looking statement for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures.
Our full-year North America revenue increased 51% over 2021 with improved margins driven by activity and pricing gains. Both our drilling and evaluation and completion and production divisions grew revenue and margins this year. The drilling and evaluation division generated full-year operating margins of 15%, an increase of 320 basis points over 2021. The steady expansion of D&E margins demonstrates the global competitiveness of our D&E business.
Our success this quarter and throughout 2022 was a direct result of your hard work and dedication. I thank you for your relentless focus on safety, operational execution, customer collaboration, and service quality performance. Now, let's turn to the macro outlook where everything I see today points toward continued oil and gas tightness. On the supply side, in the US, an increased spend of almost 50% and activity growth of nearly 30% yielded a production increase of about 5%.
The unique feature of this upcycle, as I see it, is the investor driven return discipline by both operators and service companies, which I expect drives a longer duration cycle and translates into years of increasing demand for Halliburton services. Now, let's turn to Halliburton, starting with our performance in the international markets. We successfully executed our strategy to deliver profitable international growth through competitive technology offerings, improved pricing, and selective contract wins. International revenue grew 20% year on year with strong growth and margin expansion from both divisions.
About half our revenue comes from international markets. We have leading positions in key well construction product lines and a strong geographic footprint. I'm excited about the growth and profit opportunities that will come with the adoption of our new drilling technology platforms. Our iCruise drilling technology, iStar logging while drilling platform, and LOGIX automation capabilities.
Our performance demonstrated our strategy to maximize value in North America through capital efficiency, improved pricing, differentiated technology, and alignment with high-quality customers. In 2022, our North America revenue grew 51% year over year, while revenue in the fourth quarter was flat sequentially due to weather related downtime late in the year. Looking ahead, we expect strong activity and anticipate customer spending to grow by at least 15% in 2023. The market for equipment is tight.
Lead times for new and replacement equipment remain long, and service companies remain disciplined. Our completions calendar is fully booked and pricing continues to improve across all product service lines. Against this constructive market backdrop, Halliburton will outperform with our unique strategy to maximize value. We see strong demand for our Zeus e-fleets with several repeat customers contracting additional fleets.
We will continue to sharpen our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. I am confident in Halliburton's strong long-term outlook. This is the best setup and market outlook for oilfield services and Halliburton that I have seen in a very long time. Our exceptional financial performance this year is a clear result of the execution of our strategic priorities to maximize value in North America, deliver profitable international growth, and drive capital efficiency.
Despite weather related downtime late in the year, C&P delivered an operating income margin of 20.7%, the highest operating income margin since 2012. This was due to improved pricing, service efficiency, and activity mix in North America land, as well as increased activity in international markets. In our drilling and evaluation division, revenue in the fourth quarter was $2.4 billion, an increase of 8% when compared to the third quarter, while operating income was $387 million, an increase of 19% when compared to the third quarter. These results were driven by higher year-end software sales and an uptick in international activity.
Our normalized effective tax rate for the fourth quarter came in at approximately 21%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our first-quarter effective tax rate to increase roughly 150 basis points. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $350 million with our 2022 full-year capex totaling approximately $1 billion. Turning to cash flow.
For the full year, we generated $2.2 billion of cash from operations and delivered approximately $1.4 billion of free cash flow. As a result, we ended the year with approximately $2.3 billion in cash. Next, I'd like to provide a few more details about our capital return framework. First, an important pillar of our capital framework is to maintain capex between 5% and 6% of revenue.
I believe the spending level is appropriate and supports our earnings growth and free cash flow generation over the next several years. Second, we expect to return a minimum of 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Our board of directors increased our quarterly dividend by 33% to $0.16 per share, effective with a dividend payment in March 2023. Finally, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased $250 million of shares, and we have remaining authorization of approximately $5 billion.
We were clear about our goals to reduce debt and increased cash returns to shareholders, and I am pleased that we've announced these actions today. I believe Halliburton's capital return framework provides visibility for investors and affords us the flexibility to pursue acquisitions and strengthen the balance sheet. Now, let me provide you with some comments on how we see the first quarter. As is typical, our results will be subject to weather related seasonality and the roll-off of year end product sales, which will mostly impact our international business.
Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Oil and gas is tight, and only multiple years of increased investment will solve short supply, which translates into years of increasing demand for Halliburton services. The announced dividend increase, share buybacks, and Halliburton's new capital return framework provides shareholders with clarity and consistency on how we expect to return cash to shareholders.",24.0,Medium
JKHY,2022,1,"And on the call with me today is David Foss, board Chair, president and CEO of Jack Henry. In just a minute, I'll turn the call over to Dave to provide some of his thoughts about the state of our business, financial and sales performance for the quarter, comments regarding the industry in general and some other key initiatives that we have in place. Then after Dave concludes his comments, I will provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market close and also provide some comments regarding our updated guidance for our fiscal year 2022 provided in the release yesterday. And then we will open the lines up for Q&A.
On this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for historical non-GAAP financial measures can be found in yesterday's press release. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave. 
Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our first fiscal quarter, particularly in light of the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic.
In our ongoing attempt to communicate effectively regarding our ESG-related efforts, we recently published our ESG statement, which provides a succinct and centralized overview of Jack Henry's ESG commitments and material environmental and social topics. Additionally, it points readers toward other related policies like our human rights policy. We've also published an environmental policy that highlights our commitment to sustainability and proper environmental management practices. Both documents can be found on our new corporate responsibility website via investor relations.
We created this website to house our sustainability reports and provide a centralized location for Jack Henry's ESG information. Speaking of sustainability reports, our next sustainability report covering calendar year 2021 will be published in March. We have continued to make major advances across our environmental, social and governance initiatives, and the board has established a quarterly cadence to discuss ESG matters. As we move forward, I'm very optimistic regarding our levels of sales activity and customer responses to solutions we're delivering and the strategies we are executing.
We had margin expansion in all three of our reporting operating segments on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal '22 increased to 23.4% compared to 22.4% in the same quarter a year ago, which is in line with the guidance we provided on the previous call. Our net income grew 12% to $102.1 million for the first fiscal quarter compared to $91.2 million last year, with earnings per share of $1.38 for the quarter compared to $1.19 last year for a $0.19 or 16% increase year over year. For cash flow, our total amortization increased 2% for the quarter compared to last year due to capitalized software projects being placed into service.
Included in total amortization is the amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, which decreased to $4.3 million this year compared to $4.4 million in last year's quarter. Our depreciation was down 2% compared to the prior fiscal year. And during the quarter, we paid dividends of $34 million. Our operating cash flow was $106.5 million for the year, which was down from $114.5 million last year, which decreased primarily due to the timing and change of various operating assets and liabilities considered in the calculation of operating cash flow.
We invested $46.5 million back into our company through capex and capitalized software. Our free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capex and cap software and adding back net proceeds from disposed assets, was $60.1 million for the quarter. Our cash position at September 30 was $44.3 million compared to $195.3 million a year ago, primarily due to the significant stock repurchasing we did last year. We had $65 million drawn on our revolver at the end of the quarter, and we had no other long-term debt on our balance sheet other than leases.
For non-GAAP revenue growth, we continue to guide to a range of seven and a half to 8% growth for the fiscal year. Obviously, these will be updated during the year. We continue to anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins to improve in FY '22 compared to last year as we should have very nice margin expansion in our payments segment and anticipate higher deconversion fees. However, I continue to be somewhat cautious on guiding to too much of an operating margin expansion as we will continue to have headwinds on license and order revenue as we continue to move core customers from on-premise to our private cloud, and also travel costs will continue to increase significantly compared to the prior year.
Our effective tax rate for FY '22 continues to be projected slightly higher at approximately 23% compared to the prior year, obviously, significant changes in corporate tax structure could change this guidance. And our FY '22 GAAP EPS guidance is a range of $4.64 to $4.73, which is an increase from the prior guidance of $4.53 to $4.60. This concludes our opening comments. We are now ready to take questions.",15.0,Low
JKHY,2022,2,"And on the call with me today is David Foss, board chair and CEO. The format for our call this morning will be just a little different than our normal format we've typically used in the past. But just a warning, the opening comments will take a little longer than normal. In just a minute, I will turn the call over to Dave to provide some of his thoughts about the state of our business, financial and sales performance for the quarter, comments regarding the industry in general and some other key initiatives that we have in place.
Then after Dave concludes his comments, I will provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market closed and provide comments regarding our updated guidance for our fiscal year 2022 provided in the release. At that point, Dave has some additional comments and updates that he will make on the press release that we put out Monday morning. Then at the conclusion of those comments, we will then open the lines up for a traditional Q&A. First, I need to remind you that this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results.
Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled, risk factors and forward-looking statements. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income.
As Kevin mentioned in his opening remarks, we're going to conduct today's call a little differently from the cadence of past calls. I'll start with comments regarding the performance of the business in the quarter, then Kevin will share detailed financial results. Instead of moving to Q&A after Kevin's comments, however, I'm going to come back and conduct a detailed review with you of an exciting new product technology modernization strategy for our company. This is an important update for you as we believe this strategy, which we've been working on for more than two years, will fundamentally define the evolution of our company and our industry.",15.0,Low

Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to report another quarter of revenue and operating income growth and an overall solid performance by our business. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our third fiscal quarter.
Several pieces are still in production, but so far, we've been interviewed for close to 40 different articles, podcast interviews and video podcasts for publications with a combined subscriber base of more than 53 million people. Hopefully, you've all seen the new corporate sustainability report that we published on March 31. I think it's an excellent representation of the key initiatives and accomplishments we've been working on since we published our last report more than a year ago. In this new report, we provided more detail on the demographic makeup of our workforce, a summary of our employee engagement survey results, more information about our data privacy and cybersecurity practices and a significantly enhanced update on climate-related risks.
Our modernization strategy benefited significantly from Ted's years of experience speaking directly with our customers about their technology wants and needs. I'd like to thank Ted for his many years of leadership and for helping us to drive consistent success for our customers and shareholders. As you are also aware, we've been working to find a new CFO, so Kevin can enjoy a much deserved retirement. That process has been slower than I had hoped, but we expect to name a new CFO in the near future.
As we look forward to the end of our fiscal year, our sales pipeline is very strong, and we continue to be optimistic about the strength of our technology solutions, our ability to deliver outstanding service to our customers, our ability to expand our customer relationships, the spending environment and our long-term prospects for success. I look forward to seeing and chatting with many of you at our investor day in Dallas next Monday. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers.
On a non-GAAP basis, our operating margins expanded from 20.3% last year to 20.9% this year for a 60 bps expansion. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 increased to 23.6% compared to 21.5% in the same quarter a year ago, which is in line with the guidance we've provided for the year. Net income grew 19% to $84.7 million for the third fiscal quarter compared to $71.4 million last year with earnings per share of $1.16 for the current quarter compared to $0.95 last year, for a $0.21 or a 22% increase over the previous year quarter. Some comments on cash flow.
Our total amortization increased 2.6% for the year to date compared to last year due to capitalized software projects being placed in service. Included in total amortization is amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, which decreased to $12.4 million this year to date compared to $13.3 million last year's first three quarters of the fiscal year. Depreciation actually decreased 3.7% compared to the first nine months of the prior fiscal year. Operating cash flow was $301.4 million for the year to date, which is up from $266.3 million last year, which this is primarily due to increased net income during the first nine months compared to the previous year and the timing and change of various operating assets and liabilities considered in the calculation of operating cash flow.
For non-GAAP revenue growth, we continue to guide to be just under 9% growth for the fiscal year. We continue to anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins to improve a little in FY '22 compared to last year. But again, I continue to be somewhat cautious on guiding too much of a non-GAAP operating margin expansion as we continue to have headwinds on license and hardware revenue as we continue to move more core customers from on-premise to our private cloud. Also, our travel costs continued to increase significantly compared to the prior year.
However, we are still comfortable that full year non-GAAP operating margins will expand approximately 50 bps or higher but also a reminder, the highest margin quarter is our Q1 due to software subscriptions in that quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year continues to be projected to be slightly higher than 23% compared to the prior-year rate. And our updated FY '22 GAAP EPS guidance is now a range of $4.80 to $4.85, which is an increase from the previous guidance of $4.75 to $4.80 a share. That concludes our opening comments, and we are now ready to take questions.",15.0,Low
JNJ,2022,1,"Good morning. This is Joe Wolk, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Johnson & Johnson. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our company's first quarter 2022 financial results and full year 2022 outlook. While many things have changed in the world since our last call, much has stayed the same for Johnson & Johnson.
We continue to deliver reliable growth and generate meaningful free cash flow, enabling us to invest and advance our pipeline, increase our dividend for the 60th consecutive year, and continued to make a positive impact across the landscape of healthcare. It is, however, important to take a few moments to recognize the current events that are impacting the world we're living in. Today, while we're all still managing through the global pandemic, as evidenced by the current surge of cases in China, we also acknowledge the increasing hardship brought on by the war in Ukraine. We remain focused on the safety of our employees and their families.
Thank you, Joe. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, our future operating and financial performance, and the anticipated separation of the company's Consumer Health business.
We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation, which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other marketplace dynamics. This means that results could change at any time, and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results and outlook is a best estimate based on the information available as of today's date. A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2021 Form 10-K, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures.
These materials are also available at investor.jnj.com. Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda, I will review the first quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the three segments.
Following, Joe will provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, our capital allocation priorities, and updated guidance for 2022. The remaining time will be available for your questions. During the Q&A portion of the call, Joe will be joined by, Ashley McEvoy, executive vice president and worldwide chair, MedTech; Thibaut Mongon, executive vice president and worldwide chair, Consumer Health; and Jennifer Taubert, executive vice president and worldwide chair, Pharmaceutical. We have heard your feedback and are implementing a few enhancements this quarter.
For the quarter, net earnings were $5.1 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.93 versus diluted earnings per share of $2.32 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $7.1 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.67, representing increases of 3% and 3.1%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2021. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 6.2%. I will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights.
Consumer Health was negatively impacted by industrywide external supply constraints, primarily due to ingredients and packaging availability as well as labor shortages largely reflected in our skin health and beauty business, worth approximately 280 basis points worldwide and 500 basis points in the US. Adjusting for these constraints, Consumer Health delivered solid results, primarily due to above-market growth in OTC driven by increased Tylenol, Motrin, and upper respiratory product sales. Moving on to our pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $12.9 billion increased 9.3% with growth of 2.9% in the US and 16.7% outside of the US.
Imbruvica sales declined 3.9% worldwide due to increased competition from novel oral agents, particularly in US. Imbruvica maintains its market leadership position worldwide and continues to drive growth outside of the US despite ongoing competitive pressures. Xarelto sales declined 13.8% in the US, driven largely by a net unfavorable prior period price adjustment and increased cost for patient access, partially offset by continued demand and market growth. The COVID-19 vaccine also contributed approximately $500 million to sales in the quarter.
Contact lenses global growth of 10.6% reflects continued positive momentum for our market-leading Acuvue portfolio, success of commercial initiatives, and recently launched products such as Acuvue Oasys Multifocal and Acuvue Define Fresh. Surgical vision delivered global growth of 23.8%, with both the US and OUS posting growth above 20%, fueled by market recovery and share momentum due to the success of recently launched products, including Tecnis Eyhance and Tecnis Synergy. As a reminder, additional sales commentary for all of our segments can be found on the slides. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2022.
The other income and expense line was net income of $102 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared to net income of $882 million in the first quarter of 2021. This decrease was the result of lapping prior-year gains on the divestiture of Doxil, Caelyx, and Evra in 2021, higher unrealized losses on securities and Consumer Health separation costs. This was partially offset by favorable returns associated with our employee benefit plans. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 12.2% versus 16.6% in the same period last year.
The decreased tax rate was primarily driven by lower US income due to higher unrealized losses on securities and the impairment of bermekimab IP R&D compared to prior-year divestiture gains. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 13.3% versus 16.5% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming first quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share, adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items.
As Jess just mentioned, Johnson & Johnson posted solid performance for the quarter, continuing to invest in the business for the long-term success, while overcoming multiple macroeconomic headwinds, including inflationary pressures and higher input costs. These external challenges include limited availability and rising prices of certain commodities; as well as increased costs for labor, energy, and transportation. These impacts are pervasive across the enterprise, but most notable in Consumer Health. We expect these pressures will continue to some degree throughout the remainder of 2022.
However, mitigation efforts are underway, including cost improvement initiatives, strategic price increases, and contract negotiations with external supply partners. We are committed to sustaining supply of the products, medicines, and treatments that consumers and patients want and need. Turning to our segments and notable events in the quarter. MedTech led our enterprise performance with nearly 9% adjusted operational sales growth.
In our Consumer Health business, we remain focused on delivering on our 2022 performance objectives, continuing to achieve above-market growth in our over-the-counter medicines business, while navigating industrywide supply constraints that have primarily impacted our skin health/beauty business. We continue to be excited about the activity related to the announcement we made in November on the creation of two new industry-leading companies, the new Johnson & Johnson and the new Consumer Health Company. For the new Johnson & Johnson, the portfolio will remain well diversified with 25 brands delivering over $1 billion in sales annually, holding market-leading positions across key therapeutic areas and franchises. The financial hallmarks of Johnson & Johnson will remain the same, including a well-defined capital allocation strategy, a disciplined approach to inorganic growth, and a strong balance sheet, while also creating opportunities to sharpen focus on execution and clinically differentiated innovation.
Our time lines remain unchanged. We anticipate announcing key executive leadership appointments for the new Consumer Health Company in the coming months, with plans to provide the new company name and headquarters location around the middle of this year. In the second half of 2022, we plan to provide the updated path forward and applicable financial information such as refined standup cost estimates and potential short-term dis-synergies. Finally, consistent with previous communications, we expect to execute the separation in 2023.
You have our ongoing commitment adhering to the regulatory framework to provide transparent updates for material decisions on a timely basis. Turning now to cash and capital allocation. We generated free cash flow for the quarter of nearly $3.4 billion. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $30 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $33 billion of debt for a net debt position of approximately $3 billion.
Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Internal innovation remains critical to our future growth and a top priority. In the first quarter, we increased R&D investment by approximately 9% compared to the first quarter of 2021. We also continue to evaluate opportunities to complement the current portfolio with acquisitions that build upon our capabilities, address portfolio gaps, or play in higher-growth markets while yielding solid financial returns.
This will enable investors to focus on the performance of our core businesses, which drive the current and future value for investors. We are maintaining the total adjusted operational earnings per share guidance we provided in January, absorbing if need be, the modest income impact from the COVID-19 vaccine. Regarding foreign exchange, as you know, we don't offer guidance or predictions on currency movements. But to give you a sense of the impact currency may have on potential full year reported results, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the US dollar as of last week at 1.08, there is an incremental unfavorable currency impact of $1.1 billion on reported sales and an unfavorable $0.25 for reported adjusted earnings per share versus the calculation related to January's guidance.
In Consumer Health, we expect supply constraints to continue throughout the year but not to the same extent in the second half. As a result, we anticipate that the back half performance will improve over the first half. For MedTech, while the first quarter demonstrated faster recovery than we anticipated, our full year expectations remain fairly intact. We anticipate continued market recovery and uptake from recently launched products and are monitoring the ever-changing COVID dynamics, particularly the surging cases in China.",25.0,Medium
JNJ,2022,2,"Let me remind you of those priorities. First, we will continue to advance our industry-leading success in pharmaceuticals by delivering the innovative pipeline we highlighted at our pharmaceutical business review last November. This includes our goal to grow this sector to $60 billion by 2025, with growth in every year, including years facing the Stelara loss of exclusivity and continuing to deliver above-market compounded annual growth of at least 5%. In the second quarter, we saw evidence of this plan coming to fruition with the launch of Carvykti in April.
The new Johnson & Johnson comprising our pharmaceutical and MedTech businesses will remain the largest, most diversified healthcare products company in the world with over $80 billion in sales. With enhanced operational focus, the new Johnson & Johnson will be poised to bring integrated, comprehensive, disease-centric technology, and innovative solutions to enhance patient care. Our balance sheet will remain strong, allowing us to pursue both organic and inorganic opportunities in higher-growth markets across both segments while maintaining our strong dividend distribution. With these clear priorities in place, we are confident in our ability to execute on both our short-term and long-term objectives.
We are very pleased to have delivered solid sales and earnings growth through the first half of 2022, reporting adjusted operational sales and EPS growth of 8% and 8.5%, respectively. Joe Jess will share details reflecting above-market adjusted operational sales growth from pharmaceuticals and continued resiliency in both MedTech and consumer health results that stand out given the current global macroeconomic challenges. We are well-positioned across the globe to sustain our leadership position in healthcare. We aspire to accelerate growth while maintaining the diversification in our business and our discipline around capital allocation, which have been foundational to our success for over the past 135 years.
Thank you, Joaquin. This is Jessica Moore, vice president of investor relations for Johnson & Johnson. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules, on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. We continue to implement enhancements in order to assist you in evaluating our performance.
We anticipate the webcast will last up to 60 minutes. Now let's move to second quarter results. Worldwide sales were $24 billion for the second quarter of 2022, an increase of 3% versus the second quarter of 2021. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 8% as currency had a negative impact of five points.
Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 8.1% worldwide, 2.4% in the U.S., and 14.2% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4.8 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.80 versus diluted earnings per share of $2.35 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.9 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.59, representing increases of 4.3% and 4.4%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2021.
Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 12.3% as currency had a negative impact of 5.6 points. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, Worldwide growth was 12.4%. Excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, Worldwide operational sales growth was 8.6%. Results in the quarter were impacted by unfavorable prior period adjustments, offset by favorable discounts.
This represents 5.4 points and 7.4 points of share gain, respectively, in the U.S. Results in the quarter benefited from favorable discounts, partially offset by unfavorable prior period adjustments for a net favorable impact of approximately 400 basis points. Tremfya grew 29.7%, driven by market growth and share gains in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. This represents 2.3 points and 3.2 points of share gain, respectively, in the U.S.
Results in the quarter were impacted by an unfavorable prior period adjustment of approximately 750 basis points in unfavorable patient mix. Imbruvica operational sales declined 7.2% worldwide due to increased competition, particularly in the U.S. Imbruvica maintains its market leadership position worldwide and continues to drive operational growth outside of the U.S. despite ongoing competitive pressures.
For additional context, all franchises were affected by regional COVID-19 mobility restrictions and selling days had an immaterial impact on results in the quarter. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2022. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 50 basis points, primarily driven by increased supply network-related cost with the COVID-19 vaccine and inflation, partially offset by favorable mix.
Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 17.6% versus 5.8% in the same period last year. This was primarily driven by a 2021 onetime tax benefit from an internal reorganization of certain international subsidiaries. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 15.4% versus 14.8% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming second quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters.
Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2022, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 33.4% to 34%, primarily driven by favorable product and segment mix, partially offset by inflation and portfolio progression in R&D. pharmaceutical margin improved from 39.4% to 42%, primarily driven by favorable product mix and brand marketing expense leverage.
We noted in April, and are doing so again today, that these pressures will continue to impact margins in the third and fourth quarters and into 2023. As such, we continue to pursue mitigation efforts, including cost-improvement initiatives, strategic price increases, and contract negotiations with external supply partners. As for segment performance and key events in the quarter, in MedTech, you may recall that performance in Q2 2021 was the strongest of the year for most of the MedTech peer set, including Johnson & Johnson, making this second quarter our toughest comp. On a sequential operational basis and in line with our expectations, we did see an acceleration in sales, even considering the regional COVID-19-related mobility restrictions this quarter.
In our consumer health business, similar to MedTech, Q2 of 2021 was last year's strongest quarter with 10% adjusted operational sales growth. We remain focused on our 2022 performance objectives of delivering above-market growth in our over-the-counter medicines business while overcoming industrywide supply constraints and inflationary pressures that are primarily impacting our skin health business. We continue to be excited about the creation of the new consumer health company. Great work is being done by our teams to effect this complex transaction.
We look forward to sharing the new consumer health company's name and branding as well as the headquarters location in the months ahead. Similarly, we look forward to sharing transaction options and further financial details, adhering to regulatory policies later in 2022. Finally, I would like to offer my congratulations to Thibaut, Paul, and the rest of the leadership team regarding their recent appointments. Turning now to cash and capital allocation.
In the first half of the year, we increased R&D investment by approximately 9% compared to the first half of 2021. The dividend priority Joaquin referenced translated to us distributing $6 billion to shareholders so far this year. We also continue to vigorously evaluate acquisition opportunities that would enhance the current portfolio, build upon our capabilities, and enable us to play in higher-growth markets while yielding solid financial returns. Moving to full year 2022 guidance and key considerations.
The major takeaway is we are maintaining the midpoints of our guidance for adjusted operational sales growth of 7% at $97.8 billion and adjusted operational earnings per share of $10.70 or 9.2% growth for the full year. Given our confidence in delivering full year guidance, based on what we know today, we are tightening the adjusted earnings per share range from $10.65 to $10.75 on a constant currency basis. Regarding the remainder of the P&L, there are a few updates. Due to the prolonged impact of inflationary pressures, we are updating our operating margins to be flat versus 2021.
Finally, we are lowering our effective tax rate estimate, which is reflective of current law, to a range of 15% to 15.5% based on our year-to-date progression. As we always do, let me give you a sense of the impact currency may have on potential full year reported results, specifically the strengthening U.S. dollar. Utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S.
dollar as of last week at 1.0, there is an incremental unfavorable currency impact of $1.5 billion on reported sales and an unfavorable $0.20 impact for the estimated reported adjusted earnings per share versus the projection utilized in April's guidance. The full year unfavorable impact is now projected to be $4 billion on reported sales and $0.65 on reported adjusted earnings per share. As this chart illustrates, it's not just that the euro and U.S. dollar have reached parity, something we haven't seen in nearly two decades.
It's also the rapid pace at which the fluctuations are occurring, a dynamic only experienced a few times over that same period. In addition, while it's much too early to comment on 2023, we do think it is helpful to point out what the currency impact may be if current assumptions for our estimate holds. Of the current $0.65 unfavorable impact I just referenced, about $0.30 to $0.35 will carry over into 2023's EPS. Certainly, there's a long way to go before we finalize next year's outlook, but wanted to give you a sense of how to think about the foreign currency impact.
Back to the current year. In terms of 2022 quarterly phasing considerations for your models, we continue to estimate that the back half will improve over the first half with a slight bias for higher growth in Q4 over Q3. In consumer health, we have seen quarter-over-quarter reduction in supply disruptions that we anticipate will continue. We also expect to see the benefit of recent strategic price increases in the back half of the year.
For pharmaceuticals, we anticipate delivering another year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth in our base business, with sales modestly accelerating through the end of the year. To close out the prepared remarks, Johnson & Johnson has continued to post solid results as our teams navigate a challenging external environment. Our financial performance reinforces our confidence in our ability to grow and deliver near- and long-term value. That is only possible because of our employees around the world, who we'd like to thank for remaining focused on delivering our innovative healthcare solutions and results for all of our credo stakeholders.",25.0,Medium
JNJ,2022,3,"Please note that today's meeting may include forward-looking statements relating to, among other things, the company's future financial performance, product development, market position, and business strategy, and the anticipated separation of the company's consumer health business. You're cautioned not to rely on these statements, which are based on current expectations of future events using the information available as of today's date and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A further description of these risks, uncertainties, and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2021 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC's website.
Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. These clients acknowledge those relationships.
Pharmaceutical growth was driven by strong commercial access and execution, enabling us to continue to deliver above-market adjusted operational sales growth, including five assets with double-digit growth. Growth was driven by Darzalex, Tremfya, Stelara, and Erleada, as well as our paliperidone long-acting portfolio, and was partially offset by biosimilar competition for REMICADE, along with a decrease in Imbruvica sales. Within our oncology business, Darzalex and Erleada continued to drive strong sales growth with increases of 38.7% and 51.2%, respectively. Imbruvica sales declined 7.2% worldwide due to increased competitive pressures.
and a decline of 2.9% outside of the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales growth increased 8.1%; and outside the U.S., operational sales growth increased 8.5%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 8.1%. Drivers for growth across medtech include procedure recovery, as well as focused commercial strategies and differentiated new products, such as Enseal X1 devices in energy; Velys digital solutions across our orthopedic platforms; and additional solutions enhancing our industry-leading electrophysiology portfolio.
Based on our most recent share data, we continue to enhance or sustain market share positions in the large majority of our 11 priority platforms. As a reminder, these 11 platforms each generate over $1 billion in annual sales. Partially offsetting growth in the quarter is the impact of volume-based procurement in China and timing of international tenders primarily in orthopedics and supply challenges primarily in surgical vision. Aligned with our previously communicated expectations, medtech operational sales grew sequentially versus the prior quarter.
Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 23.4% versus 4.7% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by 2022 tax costs incurred as part of the planned separation of the company's consumer health business due to the reorganization of certain international subsidiaries, a one-time special item in Q3 2021 that reduced taxable income in the quarter, and unfavorable income mix. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16% versus 13.5% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming third quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters.
MedTech margins remained flat at 25.5%. Commodity inflation and increased investment in research and development were offset by supply chain efficiencies in sales, marketing, and administrative leveraging. Finally, consumer health margins improved from 24.2% to 24.3% despite inflationary pressures, driven by price actions and investment prioritization. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson third quarter results.
Let me share a few enterprise highlights from the quarter. We continue to deploy effective strategies to provide the products, medicines, and treatments that consumers and patients rely on in the face of supply chain pressures. Our teams have been working tirelessly to help mitigate the impact of these challenges by working with our partners to make sure we're meeting demand. We continue to invest for growth, driven by innovation, as demonstrated by the recent opening of our R&D campus in San Francisco, which will expand our R&D presence in the Bay Area.
Congratulations, Larry. Thibaut, Ashley, and Jennifer will provide updates on notable events for their segments later in the call. Turning now to cash and capital allocation. Year to date, we generated free cash flow in excess of $13 billion.
At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $34 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $32 billion of debt for a net cash position of approximately $2 billion. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, and our strong balance sheet affords us the flexibility to pursue multiple capital allocation priorities concurrently. Investing in innovation and R&D is our top priority. And through three quarters, we have increased our R&D investment by approximately 8% over the same period last year.
Moving on to full year 2022 guidance. As evidenced by the third quarter operational sales growth across all three businesses, healthcare, as well as our business, continues to be rooted in strong fundamentals despite various macroeconomic pressures. We continue to see a strengthening U.S. dollar relative to other currencies.
And as seen on this slide, inflation in the U.S. remains at levels not experienced in decades and not unique to the U.S. You saw some of this impact reflected in this quarter's gross margin, eroding in comparison to Q3 2021, attributable to both currency and higher input cost. Despite these pressures, we are reaffirming our operational sales and reported adjusted earnings per share midpoint and tightening the ranges.
Regarding interest income and expense, again, based on our year-to-date experience whereby we have a higher cash balance earning at rates higher than previously anticipated, we are increasing the range of our estimate to $175 million to $200 million of income. And finally, we are maintaining our effective tax rate estimate, which is reflective of current law, to a range of 15% to 15.5%. Considering these revised estimates, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share on a constant-currency basis of $0.03 at the midpoint. The updated range is $10.70 to $10.75 or a midpoint of $10.73, reflecting a growth rate over 2021 of 9.5%.
While not predicting currency movements, but to provide some insights on the potential impact on EPS, our reported adjusted EPS is expected to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.68 per share. As a result and by tightening the range, our reported adjusted earnings per share is $10.02 to $10.07, which maintains the previous midpoint of $10.05. I appreciate that many of you are turning some of your attention to 2023. We are actively finalizing our plans for next year, but allow me to provide some preliminary qualitative perspectives to consider as you develop your models.
We remain confident that we'll continue to grow our pharmaceutical business every year toward our goal of $60 billion in pharmaceutical sales by 2025 despite the Stelara LOE, which is anticipated to occur in the second half of 2023 in the U.S. For medtech, we expect our investments in innovation and commercial capabilities to continue to enhance our competitiveness. At this time, we anticipate positive procedure trends with the caveats that COVID-19 continues to be a dynamic situation regionally, lingering headwinds from hospital staffing, and some impact from volume-based pricing in China. For consumer health, prior year are seeing the benefits of our strategic price increases and a reduction in supply chain disruptions, although some challenges are expected to continue into 2023.
Thank you, Thibaut. Well, good morning. So last year was clearly a banner year of our new product innovation, and we are continuing that momentum in 2022 with four new products launched, first-in-kind new products launched just in third quarter alone. And clearly, these launches are really contributing to our enhanced competitiveness.",25.0,Medium
JNJ,2022,4,"Good morning. This is Jessica Moore, vice president of investor relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of business results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022 and our financial outlook for 2023. Joining me on today's call are Joaquin Duato, chairman of the board and chief executive officer, and Joe Wolk, executive vice president, chief financial officer.
A few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder, you can find additional material, including today's presentation and associated schedules on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. Please note that today's meeting may include forward-looking statements related to, among other things, the company's future financial performance, product development, market position, and business strategy, and the anticipated separation of the company's consumer health business. You're cautioned not to rely on these statements which are based on current expectations of future events using the information available as of today's date and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected.
Moving to today's agenda, Joaquin will open with a few comments highlighting his first year as CEO and his priorities for 2023. I will then review the fourth-quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and highlights related to the three segments, as well as full-year 2022 results for the enterprise. Joe will then close with additional business commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, our capital allocation priorities, and our guidance for 2023. The remaining time will be available for your questions.
This is the result of the dedication and focus of our employees around the world, as well as the breadth and diversification of our business. There were many business achievements last year. Let me share some highlights. Our pharmaceutical team achieved its 11th consecutive year of above market adjusted operational sales growth, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, delivering nearly 7% growth as we continue to advance our innovation pipeline.
Looking ahead, well, we expect some of the headwinds that impacted 2022 to continue. We have proven that Johnson & Johnson is resilient in times of macroeconomic challenges. In this environment, our approach to 2023 can be best described as prudent, and our priorities for the year are clear and remain consistent. First, we are finalizing our plans for Johnson & Johnson to operate as a two-sector company dedicated to competitive performance, both in pharmaceutical and medtech.
We remain on track to complete the separation in 2023, as indicated in our initial announcement in November of 2021. As we look forward, our track record gives us the confidence that we can grow ahead of our peers and cement the foundation for long-term success. Following 2021, a year where we substantially increased R&D investment, we continue our commitment to organic innovation. We invested nearly $15 billion in R&D during 2022.
Also, we increased our dividend for the 60th consecutive year. We instituted a share repurchase, and we deployed over $17 billion in M&A, including the acquisition of Abiomed. Very few companies have the capability and the balance sheet to take such significant actions concurrently, especially in a year like 2022. I'm confident that we are well positioned for 2023 and beyond.
In closing, I am energized about what is to come. As the largest and most diversified healthcare products company in the world, we will continue to use our scale and breadth to drive innovations, deliver for patients, and shape the future of healthcare around the world. Now, let me turn it back to Jess.
grew by 9.1%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 9.7 points. As you will find in our supplemental sale schedules, acquisition and divestitures, as well as sales from our COVID-19 vaccine, had an immaterial impact on our results for the full year. Net earnings for the full-year 2022 were $17.9 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $6.73 versus diluted earnings per share of $7.81 a year ago. 2022 adjusted net earnings were $27 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $10.15, representing increases of 3.2% and 3.6%, respectively, versus full-year 2021.
Within our oncology business, Darzalex and Erleada continued to drive strong sales growth with increases of 33.9% and 48.6%, respectively. Zytiga sales declined 43.6% worldwide, predominantly due to loss of exclusivity in Europe in September. Imbruvica sales declined 12.3% worldwide due to competitive pressures and a suppressed CLL market due to COVID-19. Despite competitive pressures, Imbruvica maintains its market leadership position worldwide.
The other income and expense line was an expense of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to an expense of $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. This was primarily driven by one-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing-related exit costs, higher consumer health separation-related costs, higher costs related to the Abiomed acquisition, and lower gains on securities. As we announced in Q2 2022, we continue to have commitments and obligations related to the COVID-19 vaccine, including external manufacturing network exit costs and required clinical trial expenses associated with the company's modification of its COVID-19 vaccine research program and manufacturing capacity to levels that meet all remaining customer contractual requirements. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 16.2% versus 2.1% in the same period last year.
The increase was primarily driven by more income and higher tax jurisdictions versus the prior year. Additionally, the company benefited from one-time tax items in the fourth quarter of 2021 that did not repeat in the current year. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.2% versus 10.4% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming 2022 10-K filing for additional details on specific tax matters.
Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share, adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now, let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the fourth quarter of 2022, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise, as a percentage of sales, increased from 25.6% to 31.3%. Pharmaceutical margins improved from 33.9% to 38.2%, primarily driven by SG&A and R&D phasing, with higher spend earlier in the year, partially offset by the negative impact of currency and cost of products sold.
Medtech margins improved from 18.1% to 25.3%, primarily driven by SG&A and R&D phasing, with higher spend earlier in the year, favorable portfolio mix, and supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by inflationary pressures. Finally, consumer health margins improved from 18.6% to 22%, driven by brand marketing phasing with higher spend earlier in the year and supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by inflationary pressures. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 results. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk.
Thank you, Jess, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As Jess shared, we reported solid results with competitive growth across our business segments in 2022. While macroeconomic challenges and lingering COVID-19-related impacts tempered our fourth-quarter sales growth, we prioritized our top investments while managing costs to yield slightly better margin performance than guided in October to meet our earnings expectations. The business is resilient, and we should be positioned well entering 2023.
And at the end of 2022, we had approximately $24 billion of cash and marketable securities, and approximately $40 billion of debt or a net debt position of $16 billion. Despite macroeconomic uncertainty, we had a strong year deploying capital against all of our capital allocation priorities. These priorities remain unchanged. This past year, we invested more than 15% of sales, or total of nearly $15 billion, in research and development.
And based on current trends, we expect this benefit to continue through the next couple of years. We are comfortable with you modeling net interest expense between $250 million and $350 million. These figures include increased financing charges versus 2022 associated with the Abiomed acquisition. Finally, we are projecting an effective tax rate for 2023 in the range of 15.5% to 16.5% based on current tax laws and anticipated geographic income mix across our businesses.
Considering all these factors, we are guiding adjusted earnings per share in the range of $10.40 to $10.60 on a constant-currency basis, reflecting operational or constant-currency growth of approximately 2.5% to 4.5%, or 3.5% at the midpoint. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates I previously referenced, our reported adjusted operational earnings per share for the year would be favorably impacted by approximately $0.05 per share, resulting in adjusted reported earnings per share in a range of $10.45 to $10.65, or $10.55 at the midpoint, growth of 4% versus the prior year. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, I'd like to provide some qualitative considerations for your modeling. Some segment remarks, starting with pharmaceuticals.
We are assuming the following to support these statements. In pharmaceuticals, the first half of the year will be impacted by continued declines from LOE products in Europe that impacted Q4 2022 results, namely Zytiga and Invega Sustenna, as well as continued pricing pressure. Also, we expect the ramp of new product launches will occur more prominently in the second half of the year. In medtech, we expect second-half operational sales growth to be higher than the first half of the year as we anticipate ongoing procedure recovery to improve as the year progresses.
These estimates are in line with industry average for transactions such as this one given Johnson & Johnson's market cap. In terms of dis-synergies to be incurred following the completion of the separation, we are estimating between $500 million and $750 million of annual after-tax impact. We are already executing on plans to address these dis-synergies and expect to have them fully mitigated by the end of 2024. As we separate the new Johnson & Johnson, we'll also continue to reevaluate the level of ongoing financial information provided based on discussions with investors.
Overall, our approach to 2023 financial guidance should be viewed as responsibly cautious, given the many external uncertainties. We are focused on delivering competitive growth for the new Johnson & Johnson while also completing a successful consumer health separation. We are confident that our current plans position us for long-term growth and value creation for shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks.",25.0,Medium
KMI,2022,1,"Let me begin by today, we formally announced our dividend increase for 2022, taking the annual payout to $1.11. That's the fifth consecutive annual increase. Also, as Steve Kean and the team will tell you, the year is off to a good start. Now, I want to talk about broader issues that impact all of us.
We operate under a transparent legal system, and we have technical expertise from the wellhead to the burner tip that is unmatched anywhere in the world. For all of these reasons, the United States will be a major part of the solution to adequately supply the world with oil and natural gas it needs to surmount the present problem. In particular, the U.S. will be a major supplier of additional LNG to Europe to replace at least in part Russian gas.
I anticipate that all of our present LNG export facilities will be running at capacity for the foreseeable future, and the contracts necessary to support the construction of new facilities in the next few years will be more attainable than they've been in the past. By way of caution, I'm still concerned that our federal government will not properly expedite permitting of these new facilities. But I'm reasonably hopeful that at some point, this administration will recognize the importance of playing its energy card to support its allies and sanction its adversaries. The impact of these developments will benefit the midstream energy segment and Kinder Morgan specifically in both the short term and the long term.
At Kinder Morgan, we move about 40% of all the natural gas in America, and about 50% of the gas going to LNG export terminals. As volumes increase, throughput will increase as will the need for our selective expansions and extensions of the network. In short, it's a good time to be long natural gas infrastructure. Steve? 
All right. Thanks, Rich. So after wrapping up a record year financially in 2021, we're off to a strong start in 2022, with strong performance in our base business and attractive opportunities to add growth. We're keeping our balance sheet strong, exceeded our plan in the first quarter.
OK. Thanks, Steve. I'll go through the segments, starting with natural gas. Our transport volumes there were up 2% or approximately 0.9 million dekatherms per day versus the first quarter of 2021, and that was driven primarily by increased LNG deliveries generally colder weather, partially offset by the continued decline in Rockies production and a pipeline outage on EPNG.
Overall deliveries to power plants were up 5%, and we believe that natural gas power demand is becoming more inelastic relative to coal. Deliveries to LDCs and industrial also increased. The overall demand for natural gas is very strong, both our internal and WoodMac numbers project between three and four Bcf of demand growth for 2022. And in our numbers, we project growth in all major categories ResCom, industrial, power, exports to Mexico, and LNG exports.
All right. Thank you, Kim. So for the first quarter of 2022, we are declaring a dividend of $0.2775 per share, which, as Rich mentioned, is $1.11 annualized and 3% up from our 2021 dividend. For the quarter, we generated revenues of $4.3 billion, which is down $918 million from the first quarter of last year.
However, when you exclude the large nonrecurring contribution from Winter Storm Uri from last year, our revenue would have been higher this quarter versus last year. And our net income was $667 million, down from the first quarter of 2021. But excluding the contribution from Winter Storm Uri last year, our net income during the first quarter of 2021 would have been $569 million. So relative to that recurring amount, we generated $98 million or 17% higher net income this quarter versus last year.
Total DCF generated in the quarter was $1.455 billion or $0.64 per share, that's down from last year. But again, excluding the nonrecurring contributions from Winter Storm Uri, our DCF would be up $203 million or 16% higher compared to the first quarter of 2021. Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $31.4 billion of net debt with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4.4 times, that's up from 3.9 times at year-end 2021.
But excluding the nonrecurring EBITDA contributions from Uri, the year-end ratio would have been 4.6 times. So we ended the quarter favorable to our year-end recurring metrics. The net debt during the quarter increased $191 million. And here's a reconciliation of that change.
And we had a $500 million working capital use which is not uncommon in the first quarter when we have higher interest expense payments, property tax bonus payments, and we also had a rate case reserve refund paid and that explains the majority of the $191 million for the quarter. And with that, I'll turn it back to Steve.",19.0,Low
KMI,2022,2,"The rest is dependent on how that cash is utilized. At Kinder Morgan, we consistently produce solid and growing cash flow, and we demonstrated that once again this quarter. At the board and the management level, we spend a lot of time and effort deciding how to deploy that cash. As I've said ad nauseam, our goals are to maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet, fund expansion and acquisition opportunities, pay a handsome and growing dividend and further reward our shareholders by repurchasing our shares on an opportunistic basis.
That said, we are finding good opportunities to grow our pipeline network as demonstrated by our recent announcement of the expansion of our Permian Highway pipeline, which will enable additional natural gas to be transported out of the Permian Basin. So if we're generating lots of cash and using it in productive ways, why isn't that reflected at a higher price per KMI stock? Or to use that old phrase, ""If you're so smart, why ain't you rich?"" In my judgment, market pricing has disconnected from the fundamentals of the midstream energy business, resulting in a KMI yield, dividend yield approaching 7%, which seems ludicrous for a company with the stable assets of Kinder Morgan and the robust coverage of our dividend. I don't have an answer for this disconnect. And it's easy to blame factors over which we have no control, like the mistaken belief that energy companies have no future or the volatility of crude prices, which, in fact, have a relatively small impact on our financial performance.
Second, at CO2, SACROC production is well above plan. And of course, we are benefiting from higher commodity prices in this segment. The product segment is ahead of plan and terminals is right on plan. We're facing some cost headwinds, mostly because of added work this year.
While costs are up, we're actually doing very well in holding back the impacts of inflation. It's hard to measure precisely, but based on our analysis, we are well below the headline PPI numbers that you're seeing. And actually, we appear to be experiencing less than half of those increases. That's due to much good work by our procurement and operations teams, and much of this good performance is attributable to our culture.
We expect to end this year a bit better than our 4.5x debt-to-EBITDA target, giving us capacity to take advantage of opportunities and protect us from risk. As we noted at our investor day this year, having that capacity is valuable to our equity owners. Second, we invest in attractive opportunities to add to the value of the firm. We have found some incremental opportunities and expect to invest about $1.5 billion this year in expansion capital.
Again, all of these are attractive returns. And I want to emphasize, as we've said, I think many times now, our investments in the energy transition businesses we have done without sacrificing our return criteria, a nice accomplishment. In natural gas, in particular, we are focused on continuing to be the provider of choice for the growing LNG market where we expect to maintain and even expand on potentially our 50% share. And in natural gas storage, which is highly cost-effective energy storage in a market that will continue to need more flexibility, again, we are having a very good year.
Thanks, Steve. Starting with the natural gas business segment for the quarter. Transport volumes were down about 2%. That's approximately 0.6 million dekatherms per day versus the second quarter of 2021.
For LNG demand, our internal and WoodMac numbers project between 11 and 15 Bcf a day of LNG demand growth by 2028. Our natural gas gathering volumes in the quarter were up 12% compared to the second quarter of '21. Sequentially, volumes were up 6% with a big increase in the Haynesville volumes up 15% and Eagle Ford volumes up 10%. These increases were somewhat offset by lower volumes in the Bakken.
Overall, our gathering volumes in the natural gas segment were budgeted to increase by 10% for the full year, and we're currently on track to exceed that number. In our products pipeline segment, refined products volumes were down 2% for the quarter versus the second quarter of 2021. Gasoline and diesel were down 3% and 11%, respectively, but we do see a 19% increase in jet fuel demand. For July, we started the month down versus 2021 on refined products, but we have seen gasoline prices decrease nicely over the last month or so.
Thanks, Kim. For the second quarter of 2022, we're declaring a dividend of $0.2775 per share, which is $1.11 per share annualized, up 3% from our 2021 dividend. And one highlight before we begin the financial performance review. As Steve mentioned, we took advantage of a low stock price by tapping our board-approved share repurchase program.
Year to date, we've repurchased 16.1 million shares for $17.09 per share. We believe those repurchases will generate an attractive return for our shareholders. Our savings from the current dividends alone without regard to terminal value assumptions or dividend growth in the future is six and a half percent, so a nice return to our shareholders. Moving on to the second quarter financial performance.
Our adjusted earnings, which excludes certain items, including that noncash impairment, was $621 million this quarter, up 20% from adjusted earnings in the second quarter of 2021. As for our DCF performance, each of our business units generated higher EBITDA than the second quarter of last year. The natural gas segment was up $69 million with greater contributions from Stagecoach which we acquired in July of last year, greater volumes through our KinderHawk system, favorable commodity price impacts on our Altamont and Copano South Texas systems and those are partially offset by lower contributions from CIG. The products segment was up $6 million driven by favorable price impacts, partially offset by lower crude volumes on Hiland and HH as well as higher integrity costs.
So we ended the quarter favorable to our year-end recurring metric. Our net debt has decreased $185 million Year to date, and I will reconcile that change to the end of the second quarter. We've generated year-to-date DCF of $2.631 billion. We've paid out dividends of $1.2 billion.",19.0,Low
KMI,2022,3,"Gulf Coast. While this situation is, in my opinion, unfortunate and poor public policy, it does make existing infrastructure even more valuable. I don't think that value is fully recognized by the equity markets. The difficulty in building new pipeline and ancillary facilities widens the moat to use long bucket sprays around existing assets at a company like KMI.
That's an obvious source of additional value. But beyond that, having such an extensive network already in place affords great opportunity for a company like ours to extend and expand our assets on an incremental basis without the Herculean task of permitting and building a new greenfield project. Those step-out projects can provide great service to our customers and yield a very good return for our shareholders. We're fortunate at KMI that a large portion of our network is in Texas and Louisiana, states that understand and appreciate the need for new energy infrastructure and where so much of the demand for additional throughput, particularly natural gas, is located.
Let me be more specific. The demand for natural gas in those states is projected to grow enormously over the rest of this decade. That growth is driven by a number of end users but let me just focus on LNG export facilities. Year-to-date, in 2022, LNG is consuming over 11 Bcf a day and that number incorporates the absence of roughly two Bcf a day of demand from the Freeport facility, which has been shut down since June.
We are facing cost headwinds, mostly because of added work this year. But while costs are up, we're actually doing very well in holding back the impacts of inflation. It's hard to measure precisely but based on our analysis of what we can reliably track, we are well below the headline PPI numbers that you're seeing. Actually, we appear to be experiencing about half of that increase.
Much good work by our procurement and operations teams and much of this good performance is attributable to our culture. We are frugal with our investors' money. Looking ahead, we are seeing good opportunities across our network and in gas, in particular, Rich emphasized LNG, and that is clearly the biggest long-term opportunity and our network is especially well positioned. I'll give you an illustration of that.
Again, we're having a very good year, and we are setting our business up well for the future. Our balance sheet is strong. We are seeing good value, particularly in natural gas and renewables. We are finding and executing on projects with attractive returns, and we are returning value to shareholders.
Again, that's due to the Freeport LNG outage. Deliveries to power plants were robust in the quarter, they were up about 11%, driven by record summer power demand, that's 880 million dekatherms per day of incremental gas moving to power plants. It's pretty incredible. Our natural gas gathering volumes were up about 13% in the quarter compared to the third quarter of '21 and that was driven by the Haynesville volumes, which were up about 70%.
Sequentially, volumes are up 6% with big increases in the Bakken, up 14%, Haynesville, 8%, and Eagle Ford, up 7%. Overall, our natural gas gathering volumes were budgeted to increase about 10% for the full year and we're currently on track for about 13%. Overall demand for natural gas is very strong, as both Rich and Steve mentioned, driving the demand for our transport and storage services, and we expect that demand to continue to grow. To add on to what Rich and Steve said, our fundamentals group estimates natural gas demand to grow from roughly 100 Bcf a day market currently to approaching 130 Bcf market by 2031.
So the world needs a reliable supplier of natural gas and the United States is positioned to be that supplier. According to the EIA, we have 80-plus years of recoverable reserves. And from an environmental perspective, the U.S. is one of the lowest emission producers in the world.
On the products segment, refined products volumes were down about 2% in the quarter versus the third quarter of '21, slightly outperforming EIA, which was down 3%. Gasoline and diesel were down 3% and 5%, respectively. But we did see an 11% increase in jet fuel demand. For October, we started the month a little bit stronger than the Q3 results.
We currently project that we will exceed our full year guidance on DCF per share and EBITDA by 4% to 5%. Timing on sustaining capex into the fourth quarter out of the second and third is the primary driver of the DCF difference between the year-to-date performance and the expected full year performance. As we progress through the year, we're seeing more high-return expansion opportunities, in the quarter, as Steve said, our backlog increased about $600 million. And as a result, going forward, we'd expect to be in the middle of our $1 billion to $2 billion range or maybe to the higher end.
Thank you, Tim. So for the third quarter of 2022, we are declaring a dividend of $0.2775 per share, which is $1.11 annualized and 3% up from our 2021 dividend. One highlight before I start on the financial performance. We continue to take advantage of our low stock price by repurchasing shares this past quarter.
We added over $90 million of repurchases to what we reported last quarter. And so, year-to-date, we have now repurchased approximately 21.7 million shares at an average price of $16.94 per share. We believe those share repurchases are going to generate an attractive return for our shareholders. Our savings from the current dividend alone without regard to the terminal value or dividend growth is 6.6%.
The year-end ratio was 4.6 times, excluding Uri EBITDA contribution. So we ended this quarter nicely favorable to the year-end metric excluding Uri. Our net debt decreased to $10 million or has decreased to $10 million year-to-date. So I'll go through a high-level reconciliation of that.
We've generated year-to-date DCF of $3.75 billion. We've paid dividends of $1.83 billion. We've contributed or repaid growth capital and contributed to joint ventures $700 million. We had $225 million of increased restricted deposits, which is mostly due to cash posted for margin related to our hedging activity.",19.0,Low
KMI,2022,4,"While we will be sorry to lose him as CEO, we are delighted that we have him in his present role until August. And that thereafter, he will continue to be a director. And I know he will contribute in that role to the future success of the company. The board and I have great faith in Kim Dang, who will transition from her present role as president into the CEO slot; and then Tom Martin, who will succeed her as president.
Both have been with Kinder Morgan for approximately 20 years. They have made extraordinary contributions to our results and culture, and we expect great things from them in the future. To sum it up, we expect a smooth transition later this year. Steve. 
Thank you, Rich. I'll give you a brief look back at what we did in 2022 and how well we have set ourselves up for the future. Kim and David will cover the substance and the details of our performance, and then we'll take your questions. Next week, we have our comprehensive annual investor conference.
There are no loss leaders here. We also returned value to shareholders in the form of a well-covered, modestly growing dividend and additional share repurchases. For 2022 alone, we've returned nearly $2.9 billion to shareholders in declared dividends and share repurchases. On the share repurchases, we have used a little under $1 billion that the board authorized.
Bottom line for investors, what we do today will be needed for decades to come. And as we are demonstrating in our products and terminals businesses, the assets we have today can accommodate the energy forms of the future. We are making the gradual pivot that the gradual energy evolution dictates. And we're doing it at attractive returns for our investors.
Road fuels were down 3%, but we saw a 10% increase in jet fuel demand. Crude and condensate volumes were down 6% in the quarter due to lower Bakken volume. Sequential volumes were down about 3%, and that was driven by lower HH volumes, that's a pipe coming out of the Bakken, due to unattractive locational pricing differentials. In our terminals business segment, our liquids utilization percentage, think about that as a percentage of our tank capacity contracted, remains high at 93%.
NGL volumes, which were much less impactful to results, were down 4%. Overall, both Steve and Rich have said, we had a fantastic quarter and year. For the quarter, DCF per share was up 13%; and for the full year, it was up 14% when you exclude the impact of Winter Storm Uri. We exceeded our full year planned DCF and EBITDA by 5% and DCF per share by 6%, coming in at or slightly above the numbers we have given you in the interim quarters.
All right. Thanks, Kim. So, for the fourth quarter of 2022, we're declaring a dividend of 27.75 cents per share, which is $1.11 per share annualized and up 3% from our '21 dividend. And I'll start with a few highlights: leverage, liquidity growth, and shareholder value.
There's some repetition here with earlier comments, but it's worth it. On leverage, we ended 2022 with the lowest year in net debt level since our 2014 consolidation transaction, and we have plenty of cushion under our leverage target of around 4.5 times. For liquidity, we ended 2022 with $745 million of cash on our balance sheet, in addition to our undrawn $4 billion worth of revolving capacity. Growth for full year 2022 versus '21, excluding the impacts from Winter Storm Uri, as Kim mentioned, we grew nicely.
Our net income was up -- was $670 million, up 5% from the fourth quarter of last year. And our adjusted earnings, which excludes certain items, was up 16% compared to the fourth quarter of '21. Our distributable cash flow performance was also very strong. Natural gas segment was up 11%, or $138 million, with growth coming from multiple assets.
Turning now to the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with $30.90 billion of net debt and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4.1 times. That's up from 3.9 times from year-end '21, but that's due to the nonrecurring EBITDA contribution from Winter Storm Uri we experienced in 2021. Excluding the Winter Storm Uri, EBITDA contribution at year-end 2021 ratio was 4.6 times. So, we ended the quarter and the year nicely favorable to the metric, excluding Uri -- excluding the Uri contribution.
We're also nicely below our long-term leverage target of around 4.5 times. And our net debt change for the full year of $278 million was driven by a number of things. So, here's a high-level reconciliation of that. Our DCF generated 4.97 billion.
As Steve said, our traditional business will be around for a long time to come. Energy is a $5 trillion global industry that is ingrained into every aspect of our lives. We'll continue to invest wisely in it as we position the company to turn slowly over time with the transition in a profitable manner. I'm also excited to work more directly with Tom.",19.0,Low
MCHP,2022,1,"Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC, that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's president and CEO; and Steve Sanghi, Microchip's executive chair. I will comment on our first-quarter fiscal-year 2022 financial performance. Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and financial business environment, as well as our guidance; and Steve will provide an update on our cash-return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
GAAP net income was $252.8 million or $0.89 per diluted share. Our June quarter GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors, notably tax reserve releases associated with statute limitations expiring. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 6% in the June quarter. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '22 to be about 6%, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years.
Our inventory balance at June 30, 2021, was $683.8 million. We had 111 days of inventory at the end of the quarter, which was down one day from the prior quarter's level. Inventory at our distributors in the June quarter were at 20 days which is a record low level and down from 22 days at the end of the prior quarter. We are ramping capacity in our internal and external factories so we can ship as much product as possible to support customer requirements.
As of June 30, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $279.7 million. We paid down $388 million of total debt in the June quarter. Over the last 12 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down almost $4 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all our excess cash beyond dividends to aggressively bring down this debt. We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during most of this time period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business, as well as our ongoing operating discipline.
We continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our adjusted EBITDA in the June quarter was a record $711.7 million and our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $2.524 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA, excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity-like in nature, was 3.34% at June 30, 2021, down from 3.71% at March 31. Our dividend payment in the June quarter was $113.1 million.
The June quarter marked 123rd consecutive quarter of non-GAAP profitability. I would like to take this occasion to thank all our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding and record results in the June quarter and especially thank the worldwide Microchip team whose tireless efforts not only delivered our strong financial results but also supported our customers to navigate a difficult environment and who worked constructively with our supply chain partners to find creative solutions in an extremely constrained and challenging environment. Taking a look at our business from a product line perspective, our microcontroller revenue was sequentially up 10.7% as compared to the March quarter and set a new quarterly record. On a year-over-year basis, our June quarter microcontroller revenue was up 26%.
Each of the 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontroller product lines established new all-time revenue records. As we have told you many times in the past, rumors of the death of 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers have been greatly exaggerated. The customers and applications served by microcontrollers are highly fragmented and require a wide range of solutions that span the breadth of our microcontroller product lines. Microcontrollers represented 57.5% of our revenue in the June quarter.
As a result, our unsupported backlog, which customers want to ship in the June quarter continued to climb significantly, resulting in lead time for many line items continuing to stretch out. We experienced constraints in all of our internal and external factories and their related manufacturing supply chains. We continue to work closely with our supply chain partners who provide wafer foundry assembly test and materials to secure additional capacity wherever possible. Through the combination of internal and external actions that we have taken, we expect -- we will be in a position to support revenue growth for at least each of the next four quarters.
We will, of course, continue to utilize the capacity available from our outsourced partners but our goal is to be less constrained by their investment priorities, which may not align with ours. We also expect that while our capital intensity may be slightly higher in any given year, and the 3% to 4% of revenue guidance we have provided in the past when looked at in the context of a rolling three-year view, we believe we will very much be in the range of our capital spending guidance. Now let me get into the guidance for the September quarter. Our backlog for the September quarter is very strong.
In addition, we have considerable backlog requested by customers in the September quarter that currently cannot be fulfilled until later quarters despite us growing capacity from last quarter. This is because the entire semiconductor supply chain remains very constrained. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the September quarter to be up between 3% and 7% sequentially. Our guidance range assumes continued operational constraints, some of which we will work through during the quarter, others that will carry over to be worked in future quarters.
At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, our year-over-year growth for the September quarter would be 25.8%. We believe achievement of this revenue level will be remarkable in and of itself, but even more so, given how resilient our business was one year ago during the pandemic because of the diversity of our end-market exposure, thus making the year-over-year comparisons that much tougher and meaningful. For the September quarter, we expect non-GAAP gross margins to be between 64.8% and 65.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 22.8% and 23.2% of sales.
Reflecting on our journey since the acquisition of Microsemi three years ago, I note the following: number one, at the time of the acquisition, we provided a long-term operating model target of 40.5% non-GAAP operating margin, which we exceeded for the first time in the March 2021 quarter and we're significantly above that in the June 2021 quarter at 41.7%. At the time of the acquisition, we also indicated that we anticipated achieving an $8 non-GAAP EPS run rate by the end of the third year after the acquisition. Between the $1.98 EPS for the June quarter we just announced, and $2.11 EPS we guided to for the September quarter at the midpoint of our guidance, we have effectively delivered on this expectation. These exceptional results were achieved despite the numerous headwinds we faced from international trade tensions and tariffs, as well as the global pandemic, which matters were not predictable three years ago.
Number two, we financed the Microsemi acquisition by adding $8.1 billion of debt, driving up our net leverage ratio in the June 2018 quarter to 4.95%, which we know was a concern for many of you. In the last three years, we have paid down a cumulative $4 billion of debt and brought our net leverage ratio down to 3.34%. We continue to allocate substantially all of our cash generation beyond what we paid to shareholders in dividends to pay down significant debt every quarter. Number three, within the last quarter, based on the debt paydown we had achieved and the continued strong cash and adjusted EBITDA generation of our business, both Moody's and Fitch changed their rating outlook from stable to a positive outlook.
At the rate we expect to pay down our debt and bring our net leverage further down, we believe we are on target to achieve an investment-grade rating sometime by the end of fiscal-year 2022. Regarding our cash return strategy, we are continuing to provide more cash return to the shareholders. Just today, we announced a dividend of $0.437 per share, our third largest dividend increase, by increasing the dividend by 5.8% sequentially and 18.75% over a year-ago quarter. And in the coming quarters, we expect to continue with more actions to increase the cash return to shareholders.",31.0,Severe
MCHP,2022,2,"All right. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone.

We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially.
We refer you to our press release of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's president and CEO; Steve Sanghi, Microchip's executive chair; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip's head of investor relations, who just joined us over the course of the last month. I will comment on our second quarter fiscal year 2022 financial performance. Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results, discuss the current business environment, as well as our guidance.
And Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release and in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com and included reconciliation information in our press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results.
We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales by product line and geography, as well as our total end market demand on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record at 65.3%, and operating income was a record 42.5%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $605.6 million. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate in the quarter was 6%.
We used cash generation during the quarter to fund the principal amount of the convertible debt exchanges, and we believe that these transactions will benefit stockholders by significantly reducing share count dilution to the extent our stock price appreciates over time. The principal amount of convertible debt on the balance sheet at September 30 was $999.2 million, compared to $4.481 billion at the beginning of calendar year 2020, putting our overall capital structure in a much better long-term position. Our cash flow from operating activities was $611.7 million in the September quarter. Our free cash flow was $533.2 million and 32.3% of net sales.
As of September 30, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $255.3 million. We paid down $415.6 million of total debt in the September quarter. And over the last 13 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down over $4.4 billion of debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends to aggressively bring down this debt. We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during much of this period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business, as well as our ongoing operating discipline.
We continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our adjusted EBITDA in the September quarter was a record at $762.5 million or 46.2% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $2.72 billion and 45% of net sales. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA, excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity-like in nature, was 2.99% at September 30, 2021, down from 3.34% at June 30, 2021.
This, in turn, enabled us to pay down another $415.6 million in debt and bring our net leverage ratio down to 2.99 in the September quarter. With the progress we have already made and progress we expect to continue making in bringing down our debt and leverage ratio, we believe we are well-positioned to achieve an investment-grade rating in the coming months. The September quarter marked our 124th consecutive quarter of non-GAAP profitability. I would like to thank all our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding and record results in the September quarter, and especially thank the worldwide Microchip team whose tireless efforts not only delivered our strong financial results, but also supported our customers to navigate a difficult supply environment and who work constructively with our supply chain partners to find creative solutions in an extremely constrained and challenging environment.
Taking a look at our revenue from a product line perspective. Our microcontroller revenue was sequentially down 0.9% as compared to the June quarter, in part due to the very strong shipments in the June quarter, when this business was sequentially up 10.7% and in part due to supply constraints in the September quarter. On a year-over-year basis, our September quarter microcontroller revenue was up 27.1%, and microcontrollers represented 54.2% of our revenue in the September quarter. Our analog revenue was sequentially up a strong 13.6% as compared to the June quarter, setting another record in the process.
Americas was up 12.5% sequentially. Europe was up 4.8% sequentially, which is better than typical seasonal performance for the September quarter. Asia was up 2.1% sequentially. All end markets were strong and supply constrained.
This is the fifth consecutive quarter that our unsupported backlog for product requested in a given quarter has grown despite our quarterly revenue having grown 26% in the September '20 first quarter as compared to the year ago quarter. We continue to experience constraints in all of our internal and external factories and their related manufacturing supply chains. During the September quarter, we experienced and were adversely impacted by COVID-related disruptions in our packaging and testing operations in Asia as the Delta variant adversely impacted many of these countries. We took additional steps to protect our employees in these countries and work with our partners as they took mitigation steps.
We also work closely with our supply chain partners who provide wafer foundry, assembly, test and materials to secure additional capacity wherever possible. It is a challenging environment for our factories and our partners' factories to hire, train and retain employees to support the planned manufacturing ramps. Despite all this, through all the actions we have taken to increase capacity, we expect we will be in a position to support revenue growth for at least each of the next four quarters. This extends by one more quarter, which we stated in our August conference call as the September quarter results are now behind us.
This licensed technology is still growing for us, and we expect it will be a workhorse technology for at least 10 to 15 more years. We believe our increase in capital spending will enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities, improve our gross margins, increase our market share and give us more control over our destiny for trailing edge technologies. We will, of course, continue to utilize the capacity available from our outsource partners but our goal is to be less constrained by their investment priorities in areas where they don't align with our business needs. Now let's get into the guidance for the December quarter.
First, we financed the Microsemi acquisition by adding $8.1 billion of debt, which increased our net leverage ratio in the June 2018 quarter to 4.95%, which we know was a concern for many of you. In the last three-plus years, we have paid down a cumulative $4.4 billion of debt and brought our net leverage ratio down to 2.99%. We allocated substantially all of our excess cash generation beyond what we pay to shareholders and dividends to pay down significant debt every quarter. Number two, within the last six months, based on the debt paydown and the continued strong cash and adjusted EBITDA generation of our business, both Moody's and Fitch changed their rating outlook from stable to a positive outlook.
And now last quarter, with very strong debt paydown and getting to a leverage ratio of below 3.0, we believe we will receive an investment-grade rating in the coming months. Regarding our capital return strategy, we are continuing to provide more cash return to the shareholders. Just today, we announced a dividend of $0.232 per share. Our dividend is reflective of Microchip's two-for-one stock split that was effective last month.
This is our fourth consecutive quarter with a large dividend increase, increasing the dividend by 6.2% sequentially and 25.9% over a year ago quarter. And in the coming quarters, we expect to continue with more actions to increase the cash return to shareholders. We plan to give you more information about our capital return strategy next week at our investor and analyst day. We hope to see you all there.",31.0,Severe

We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
Non-GAAP net income was a record $681.7 million. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 6.7% in the December quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was at the high end of our guidance and was a record $1.20. On a GAAP basis, in the December quarter, gross margins were a record at 65.6% and include the impact of $8.4 million of share-based compensation expense.
Total operating expenses were $638.3 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $215.7 million, special income of $0.3 million, $3.2 million of acquisition-related and other costs, and share-based compensation of $42.5 million. GAAP net income was $352.8 million or $0.62 per diluted share and was negatively impacted by the GAAP loss on the convertible debt exchanges we executed in the quarter, which were not included in our guidance. Our December quarter GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors, most notably, the tax expense recorded from truing up estimated taxes to actual amounts based on tax returns filed during the quarter. Our inventory balance at December 31, 2021, was $768.2 million.
We had 116 days of inventory at the end of the quarter, which was up four days from the prior quarter's level. Our levels of raw materials and work in progress increased in the quarter, which helps position us for increased production we are expecting from our internal factories and helps buffer us against unexpected shortages or changes in material lead times. The days of inventory on our balance sheet go up with our gross margin improvement, with each 100 basis points of gross margin improvement translating into approximately two to three days of increased inventory on our balance sheet. The carrying cost of our inventory has been and will be increasing due to rising input costs from our supply chain.
We are continuing to ramp capacity in our internal and external factories so we can ship as much product as possible to support customer requirements. Inventory at our distributors in the December quarter was at 19 days, which is a record low level and in line with where it was at the end of the prior quarter. During the December 2021 quarter, we achieved a milestone of becoming an investment-grade rated company. This is a goal we have been pursuing since we acquired Microsemi in May of 2018, and it positions us well for our capital return strategy that we detailed for investors at our Investor and Analyst Day back in November.
In the December quarter, we exchanged a total of $96.2 million of principal value of 2025, 2027, and 2037 convertible subordinated notes for cash and shares of our common stock. We used cash generation during the quarter to fund the principal amount of the convertible debt exchanges, and we believe that these transactions will benefit stockholders by significantly reducing share count dilution to the extent our stock price appreciates over time. The principal amount of convertible debt on our balance sheet at December 31 was $903 million, compared to $4.481 billion at the beginning of calendar 2020, putting our overall capital structure in a much better long-term position. During the December quarter, we also refinanced our revolving line of credit to be in line with our investment-grade rating and decrease the size of that facility from $3.6 billion to $2.75 billion.
Our cash flow from operating activities was a record $853.4 million in the December quarter. Our free cash flow was a record $762.7 million and 43.4% of net sales. As of December 31, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $315.5 million. We paid down $362.7 million of total debt in the December quarter.
And over the last 14 full quarters, since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down almost $4.8 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends and stock buyback to bring down this debt. We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during the earlier years of this period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business, as well as our ongoing operating discipline. We continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our adjusted EBITDA in the December quarter was a record $869.4 million and 49.5% of net sales.
Our expectation for the March 2022 quarter's capital expenditures is between $135 million and $145 million. Our capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 are expected to be between $390 million and $400 million. As a reminder, our fiscal year 2021 capital expenditures came in lower than originally planned due to longer equipment lead times and deliveries pushing out as a result of overall industry conditions. We continue to prudently add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing operations to support the expected long-term growth of the business.
Taking a look at our revenue from a product line perspective. Our microcontroller revenue was sequentially up a strong 8.7% as compared to the September quarter and was an all-time record. On an annualized basis, our December quarter microcontroller revenue at $3.9 billion is closing in on $4 billion. On a year-over-year basis, our December quarter microcontroller revenue was up 33.9%.
In the December quarter, our FPGA revenue hit an all-time record by a wide margin, and our licensing royalty revenue also hit an all-time record. Taking a look at our revenue from a geographic and end-market perspective. Americas was up 4.6% sequentially, Europe was up 11% sequentially, which is significantly better than typical seasonal performance for the December quarter, Asia was up 5.8% sequentially and all end markets were strong and supply constrained. Business conditions continue to be exceptionally strong through the quarter.
Our preferred supply program, or PSP backlog, continues to grow and is well over 50% of our aggregate backlog and 100% of our backlog in the most constrained capacity product areas. Demand far outpaced the capacity improvements and increased shipments we achieved in the quarter. As a result, our unsupported backlog, which represents backlog customers wanted shipped to them in the December quarter but which we could not deliver in the December quarter, continued to climb significantly as compared to the unsupported backlog exiting the September quarter. To illustrate the magnitude of the demand-supply imbalance.
Despite our December quarter revenue having grown 30% as compared to the year-ago quarter, we exited the December quarter with the highest unsupported backlog ever. We continue to experience constraints in all our internal and external factories and their related manufacturing supply chains. We are also experiencing some adverse impact from the rapid rise in the Omicron variant cases of the COVID-19 virus. We continue to ramp our internal factories as fast as possible, and we are working closely with our supply chain partners who provide wafer foundry, assembly, test, and materials to secure additional capacity wherever possible.
Looking at the magnitude of the demand-supply imbalance, the size of our noncancelable backlog, and the rate at which we're able to bring on new capacity, we continue to expect that we will remain supply constrained throughout 2022 and possibly beyond that. We believe our backlog position, especially the proportion of PSP backlog, is giving us a solid foundation to prudently acquire constrained raw materials, invest in expanding factory capacity and hire employees to support our factory ramps. Our planned capital spending continues to rise in response to growth opportunities in our business, as well as to fill gaps in the level of capacity investments being made by our outsourced manufacturing partners in technologies they consider to be trailing edge, but which we believe will be workhorse technologies for us for many years to come. In the December quarter, we signed a definitive agreement to purchase an assembly test factory shell in the Philippines near where we already operate our manufacturing facilities.
As we facilitize and build out this shell with equipment, we will be able to grow our internal back-end capacity for many years to come. We believe our increase in capital spending will enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities, improve our gross margins, increase our market share, and give us more control over our destiny, especially for trailing-edge technologies. We will, of course, continue to utilize the capacity available from our outsourced partners. But our goal is to be less constrained by their investment priorities in areas where they don't align with our business needs.
Finally, at our Investor Day on November 8 last year, we unveiled our Microchip 3.0 strategy, which builds on our Microchip 2.0 strategy that we successfully executed over the last decade, employing serial acquisitions to give us a solid foundation to build scale and breadth of solutions while significantly improving our gross and operating margin model. To summarize, the essential elements of Microchip 3.0 we announced were: an organic growth target of 2x the industry growth by focusing on total system solutions and the six key market megatrends; long-term non-GAAP operating margin target of 44% to 46% and free cash flow target of 38%; increased capital return to shareholders to 50% of free cash flow and further increase this every quarter to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders as net leverage drops to 1.5x; increase our capex investment to 3% to 6% of revenue and invest in 130 to 150 days of inventory over the business cycles; and finally, to maintain a strong company foundation built on culture and sustainability. As you can see from our December quarter results and the March quarter guidance, we are laser-focused on executing our Microchip 3.0 strategy. Let me now pass the baton to Steve to talk more about our capital return to shareholders.
We also paid out $129 million in dividends. Thus, the total cash return totaled $295 million. This was 50.1% of our free cash flow projection at the start of the quarter of $589 million, consistent with us targeting 50% of free cash flow as a return to our investors. However, our cash collections in the final month of the quarter were exceptional due to a very strong and linear shipping quarter and record non-GAAP gross and operating margins, and record adjusted EBITDA being well above our forecast.
Our actual free cash flow last quarter was $763 million, which was $174 million higher than our projection. Towards the end of the quarter, the stock buyback window had already closed. So, we use the extra free cash flow toward further paying down the debt. This extra paydown of debt, as well as record adjusted EBITDA, drove down our December net leverage to 2.58 from 2.99 at the end of September.
Our strategy for cash return to the shareholders was to execute it based on forecast and then true up in the following quarter. Because of the unpredictability of the free cash flow, we are simplifying the process. Going forward, we will use the actual free cash flow for the prior quarter and return our target percentage of that free cash flow to shareholders in the current quarter. So, based on this revised process, we will use our last quarter's actual free cash flow of $763 million.
This quarter, we plan to return 52.5% of this $763 million, which is $400 million to the shareholders. Out of this $400 million, the dividend is expected to be approximately $141 million, and the stock buyback is expected to be approximately $259 million. I would also like to note that on January 13, 2022, Moody's further raised Microchip's unsecured debt credit rating from prior BAA3+ to the current BAA2+. As you know, Moody's BAA2 rating is equivalent to BBB on the rating scale of S&P and Fitch.",31.0,Severe
MCHP,2022,4,"Thanks, Erin, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's president and CEO, Steve Sanghi, Microchip's executive chair; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip's head of investor relations. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2022 financial performance. Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment, as well as our guidance, and Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
Our March quarter GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors, notably the tax benefits recorded as a result of releasing the unrecognized tax benefit due to the closing of an audit in Europe. For fiscal year 2022, net sales were a record $6.82 billion and were up 25.4% from net sales in fiscal year 2021. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record 65.7%. Operating expenses were 22.2% of sales and operating income was a record 43.5% of sales.
Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 1.3% in the March quarter and 4.9% for fiscal year 2022. The non-GAAP cash tax rate in the March quarter was lower than originally forecasted, due to a variety of factors, including the receipt of a tax refund that had been forecasted to receive -- that had not been forecasted to be received until a later date, lower taxes in certain jurisdictions, and tax benefits from our convertible debt exchanges. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '23 to be between 7.5% and 11.5%, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure, and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. The midpoint of our June quarter tax rate guidance is 9.5%.
The carrying cost of our inventory has been and will be increasing due to the rising input costs from our supply chain. We are continuing to ramp capacity in our internal and external factories, so we can ship as much product as possible to support customer requirements. Inventory at our distributors in the March quarter were at 17 days, which is a record low level and down from 19 days at the end of the prior quarter. Following on the heels of our upgrade to investment grade or BBB minus in the December 2021 quarter, during the March 2022 quarter, we were upgraded to the equivalent of BBB by both Moody's and Fitch, reflecting the strength of our balance sheet, financial results, and our franchise.
In the March quarter, we exchanged a total of $64.9 million of principal value of our 2027 convertible subordinated notes for cash and shares of our common stock. We used cash generation during the quarter to fund the principal amount of the convertible debt exchanges, and we believe that these transactions will benefit stockholders by significantly reducing share count dilution to the extent our stock price appreciates over time. The principal amount of convertible debt on our balance sheet at March 31st was $838.1 million. This includes $665.5 million of convertible bonds maturing in November of 2024 with the cap call option in place that offsets any potential dilution from these convertibles up to stock prices of $116.79.
At the beginning of calendar year 2020, Microchip had $4.481 billion in convertible bonds outstanding. So today, our overall capital structure is in a much better long-term position. Our cash flow from operating activities was $747.7 million in the March quarter. Our free cash flow was $633.1 million and 34.3% of net sales.
As of March 31st, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $319.4 million. We paid down $205.9 million of total debt in the March quarter. Over the last 15 full quarters, since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down almost $5 billion of debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash, beyond dividends and stock buyback, to bring down this debt. We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during the earlier years of this period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business, as well as our ongoing operating discipline.
We continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our adjusted EBITDA in the March quarter was a record at $902.6 million and 48.9% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $3.246 billion and 47.6% of net sales. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 2.32 at March 31st, 2022, down from 2.58 at December 31st, 2021, and down from 3.76 at March 31st, 2021.
We continue to prudently add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing operations to support the expected long-term growth of our business. We expect these capital investments will bring gross margin improvement to our business, and give us increased control over our production during periods of industrywide constraints. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $59.3 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter as well as our guidance for the June quarter.
Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Our March quarter results were very strong across the board and set several records in the process. Revenue grew 4.9% sequentially and 25.7% on a year-over-year basis to achieve an all-time record of $1.84 billion. Despite a number of operational challenges, including the rapid spread of the COVID omicron virus, which affected several of our factories, the shutdowns in several cities in China, and the suspension of shipments to Russia, we finished just shy of the high end of our revenue guidance.
Net debt declined by $209.8 million, driving our net leverage ratio down to 2.32 in the March quarter, as we continue to relentlessly drive down our net leverage. During the March quarter, we returned $400.4 million to shareholders, representing 52.5% of the prior quarter's free cash flow. Reflecting on our fiscal year '22 results, it was one for the record books, and one of our best years ever. We made dramatic progress on all fronts, revenue growth, gross and operating margins, earnings per share, free cash flow generation, debt and leverage reduction, and last but not least, we significantly increased the capital return to shareholders through dividend increases and the initiation of a programmatic share buyback program.
On an annualized basis, our March quarter microcontroller revenue broke through the $4 billion mark for the first time. On a year-over-year basis, our March quarter microcontroller revenue was up 28.3%. All microcontroller product lines, 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit, experienced strong growth and achieved record revenue milestones. 32-bit microcontrollers had the highest growth and is now the largest microcontroller product line for us at 46.5% of our microcontroller revenue.
Taking a look at our revenue from a geographic and end-market perspective, Americas was up 21.4% over the prior-year quarter. Europe was up 25% over the prior-year quarter. Asia was up 27.9% over the prior-year quarter. All end markets remained strong and were supply constrained.
We continue to experience constraints in all our internal and external factories and their related manufacturing supply chains. We are ramping our internal factories as fast as reasonably possible. And we are working closely with our supply chain partners to secure additional capacity wherever possible. Our supply chain partners as well as some of our customers were adversely impacted by the lockdowns in China during March, which continued into April and May.
Our operations team worked to redirect our manufacturing activities and sourcing wherever possible to other locations that are not locked down. Looking at the magnitude of the demand-supply inbound, the size of our noncancelable backlog, the rate at which new backlog continues to come in, and the rate at which we're able to bring on new capacity, we expect that we will remain supply constrained throughout 2022 and into 2023. Our growth is predominantly limited by how quickly we can bring on additional capacity to support demand. To reiterate what we first shared with you in March this year, we expect our five-year compounded annual growth rate, using fiscal year 2021 as a baseline, to be 10% to 15%.
We expect our capital spending in fiscal year '23 to be at the high end of the range we have shared with you, as we respond to growth opportunities in our business as well as fill gaps in the level of capacity investments being made by our outsourced manufacturing partners in specialized technologies, they consider to be trailing edge, but which we believe will be workhorse technologies for us for many years to come. We believe our calibrated increase in capital spending will enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities, serve our customers better, increase our market share, improve our gross margins, and give us more control over our destiny, especially for specialized trailing-edge technologies. We will, of course, continue to utilize the capacity available from our outsourced partners, but our goal is to be less constrained by their investment priorities in areas where they don't align with our business needs. Now let's get into the guidance for the June quarter.
Our backlog for the June quarter is very strong, and we have more capacity improvements coming into effect. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the June quarter to be up between 4% and 8% sequentially. Our guidance range assumes capacity additions, as well as continued materials and capacity challenges, some of which will work -- expect to work through during the quarter, others that will carry over to be worked in future quarters. We have also included the anticipated effects of the lockdowns in China on our supply chain partners as well as our customers.
Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our cash return strategy. Reflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip that have delivered another exceptional quarter and fiscal year, while making new records in many respects, namely record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, record non-GAAP operating margin percentage, record non-GAAP EPS, and record adjusted EBITDA, and all of that in a very challenging supply environment. The board of directors announced an increase in the dividend of 9.1% from last quarter to $0.276 per share.
This is an increase of 33.7% from a year-ago quarter. During the last quarter, we purchased $259.6 million of our stock in the open market. We also paid out $140.8 million in dividends. Thus, the total cash return was $400.4 million.
This amount was 52% of our actual free cash flow of $762.7 million during the December 2021 quarter. Our paydown of debt, as well as record adjusted EBITDA, drove down our net leverage at the end of March 2022 quarter to 2.32 from 2.58 at the end of December. In the current June quarter, we will use last quarter's actual free cash flow of $633.1 million and expect to return $348.2 million, which is 55% of that amount to our shareholders. Out of this $348.2 million, the dividend is expected to be approximately $153.2 million and the stock buyback is expected to be approximately $195 million.",31.0,Severe
MPC,2022,1,"Thanks, Kristina. Before we get into our results for the quarter, we wanted to provide a brief update on the macro environment. Year over year, demand trends have been, for the most part, positive and the market seems to have reached a post-COVID point of stability. Distillate remains stable, Jet continues to recover, and gasoline has been more resilient than we would have expected given normal seasonality and recent geopolitical events.
We expect continued volatility in 2022 with an advantage for safe, reliable, and low-cost operators. We are focused on optimizing our maintenance schedules to maximize uptime and allow us to do what we can to produce volumes to meet the market demand. As we do this, we remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. With this in mind, we anticipate the U.S.
refining system running at higher utilization rates in the coming quarters to meet rising demand. MPC's first quarter results reflect the continued recovery for our products and services which supported higher margins and higher throughput across regions. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $2.6 billion. We repurchased $2.8 billion in shares in the quarter.
Our intended partnership with Neste also creates a platform for additional collaboration within renewables. We believe there will be opportunities to leverage this partnership between two industry leaders as we pursue our shared commitment to the energy evolution and the goal of leading in sustainable energy. MPC will manage project execution and operate the facility once construction is complete. Additionally, MPLX Logistics assets support Martinez will remain owned and operated by MPLX.
In February, we became the first among our peers to establish a 2030 target to reduce absolute Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 15% below 2019 levels. The new Scope 3 target further enhances MPC's disclosures in addition to our existing Scope 1 and 2 reduction targets. MPLX also established a new 2030 target to reduce methane emissions intensity from natural gas gathering and processing operations by 75% below 2016 levels. In the second quarter, we will publish our annual sustainability and perspectives on climate-related scenarios reports and provide updates on the progress on the goals we have previously said.
Thanks, Mike. Slide 6 provides a summary of our first quarter financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $1.49. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.6 billion for the quarter, and cash flow from operations, excluding favorable working capital changes, was $1.9 billion, which is roughly in line with the prior quarter.
During the quarter, we returned $330 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased approximately $2.8 billion in shares, which takes us to $2.5 billion repurchased since our last earnings call. Slide 7 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from fourth quarter 2021 to the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially, driven primarily by $175 million decrease from refining and marketing. The tax rate for the quarter was 19%, which reflects the benefits from the public portion of MPLX net income, which is not taxable to MPC.
The sequential decline was driven by lower production which was primarily the result of unplanned downtime in the U.S. Gulf Coast where we experienced two unplanned outages. In the beginning of February, the Galveston Bay refinery experienced a citywide power loss, which resulted in a complete plant outage. Later in the month as we were bringing our Garyville refinery back to service following turnaround activities a fire occurred near our hydrocracker unit.
The unit was repaired and returned to service after about three weeks. Both of these events resulted in approximately $200 million of lost profit opportunity. Margin headwinds in the quarter were a result of the lower capture of 84% that we experienced this quarter and were primarily realized in the Gulf and West Coast. Operating expenses were lower in the first quarter, primarily due to lower planned project expense as well as a lower average natural gas price coupled with lower energy consumption compared to the fourth quarter.
Natural gas prices strengthened during the quarter, averaging over $0.70 in MMBtu higher in March than in January. In April, natural gas prices averaged $6.70 in MMBtu, or nearly 80% higher than the average price in 2021. The current forward strip for Henry Hub is around $8 for the rest of the year, so we would expect natural gas to be a headwind as the year progresses. Natural gas is an input cost for our refineries, which historically has represented approximately 15% of our operating costs.
Our midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter. Slide 11 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the quarter. Operating cash flow was approximately $1.9 billion in the quarter, which excludes changes in working capital. Working capital was an approximate $600 million source of cash this quarter, driven primarily by increases in crude oil prices, partially offset by increases in crude and product inventory.
In March, MPLX issued $1.5 billion worth of long-term debt, utilizing a large portion of the proceeds to repay the borrowings under the intercompany loan with MPC. During the quarter, MPC returned $330 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased approximately $2.8 billion worth of shares. Now 80% complete with our initial $10 billion capital return commitment, we could begin using the $5 billion incremental authorization starting in the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, MPC had approximately $10.6 billion in cash and short-term investments.
Planned turnaround costs are projected to be approximately $155 million in the second quarter. Expected activity is relatively light and spread through all three regions. As Mike mentioned, our optimized turnaround schedule in the second quarter is expected to allow us to run our assets safely and reliably at high utilization as we remain focused on supplying the products and services markets are demanding. Total operating costs are projected to be $5.50 per barrel for the quarter.
Earlier in the call, we shared our natural gas sensitivity, the increase we are currently seeing for natural gas costs are reflected in our second quarter guidance, on top of our average baseline $5 per barrel of operating cost. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $170 million. As we look at the impact of inflation on full year results, the two areas of focus are wages and certain supply chain inputs.
However, we have identified incremental sustainable cost reductions that we are executing against to offset these costs. Notwithstanding all of that, we will continue to identify the headwind from rising energy cost to our refining system throughout the year. Slide 13 provides our capital investment plan for 2022. Once we have closed on the Martinez JV, MPC will receive $400 million and be reimbursed for 50% of the capital spent to date.",29.0,Medium
MPC,2022,2,"Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, our operational activity was driven by strong market demand for transportation fuels we manufacture. Demand remains resilient, largely driven by the removal of globally imposed mobility restrictions and the pent-up desire to travel.
Jet fuel demand continued its recovery, up nearly 20% from the same quarter last year, with the increased resumption of travel. Gasoline demand remained very resilient through the quarter in part due to the start of the summer driving season. Diesel demand after a strong beginning to the year, softened a bit in the second quarter due to lower trucking volumes. During the second quarter, in order to meet robust customer demand, we ran our refining system at full utilization.
But looking forward, we expect tight supply, low inventory levels and strong global demand to continue to incentivize high refining runs into the third quarter. We will continue to execute on what we can control running a safe, reliable, low-cost system, improving our commercial performance and strengthening the competitive performance of our assets. On capital allocation, we remain committed to the four priorities we previously outlined. First, we're going to take care of our assets by deploying maintenance capital.
We want to ensure we can safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees, and support the communities in which we operate. Second, we're committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. And as we've stated in the past, once we complete the $15 billion capital return program that resulted from the Speedway sale, we will reassess the level of our dividend. Third, we see this as a return on as well as the return of capital business.
The time frame for completing the facility and closing the JV are dependent upon the timing of obtaining the air quality permit. We'll continue to look for other opportunities to generate a return on capital such as cost reduction projects and opportunities that build out our competencies and increase our competitive advantages to drive returns and shareholder value. And fourth, after executing against the first three objectives, we look to return capital to shareholders. In the three months since our last earnings call, we have repurchased $4.1 billion of shares.
Thanks, Mike. Moving to our sustainability efforts. In June, we published our annual sustainability report and our annual perspective on climate scenarios report. We continue to make progress on our greenhouse gas reduction targets.
Moving to second quarter results. Slide 5 provides a summary of our second quarter financial results. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $10.61. This quarter's results were adjusted to exclude a $230 million benefit related to changes in the 2020 and 2021 RVO requirements published by the EPA.
Adjusted EBITDA was nearly $9.1 billion for the quarter and cash flow from operations, excluding favorable working capital changes was almost $7 billion. During the quarter, we returned $313 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased approximately $3.3 billion of shares. Through the end of July, we have repurchased $4.1 billion of shares since our last earnings call. Slide 6 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA and as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from first quarter 2022 to the second quarter of 2022.
Adjusted EBITDA was higher sequentially and driven primarily by an approximately $6.4 billion increase from Refining & Marketing. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 22%, resulting in a tax provision of $1.8 billion. The tax rate is higher this last quarter due to refining and marketing representing a larger component of earnings in the quarter. Moving to our segment results.
This was partially offset by strong gasoline and distillate margins as well as higher volumetric gain due to higher product prices. Product backwardation created a headwind during part of the quarter. But during this time, we were able to leverage our robust logistics capabilities to translate a portion of our physical barrels into the market on a more prompt basis. And our ability to capture 96% of the market indicator across an incredibly volatile three months was in part due to our commercial responses.
Slide 9 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the first quarter of 2022. Our Midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter. Performance is underpinned by strong operations and a commitment to strict capital discipline. MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio.
As MPLX continues to generate free cash flow, we believe it will have the capacity to return significant capital to its unitholders. Today, MPLX announced an incremental $1 billion unit repurchase authorization. Slide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. Operating cash flow was approximately $7 billion in the quarter, which excludes changes in working capital.
As Mike mentioned earlier, we remain committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. Our objective has been to complete the $15 billion repurchase program no later than the end of this year. We remain on track to meet this commitment. Upon completion of the program, we will reassess our dividend level.
As a reminder, natural gas has historically represented approximately 15% of operating costs. Our natural gas sensitivity of approximately $330 million of annual EBITDA for every $1 change per MMBtu. This equates to a sensitivity of approximately $0.30 per barrel of cost. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the third quarter.",29.0,Medium
MPC,2022,3,"Sounds great. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO; and other members of the executive team.
Most recently, he was executive vice president of pipelines, terminals and marine and chief commercial officer, where he oversaw the business development for the MLP. Now, turning to the macro environment. Roughly 4 million barrels per day of refining capacity has come offline globally in the last couple of years. Yet demand for the transportation fuels we manufacture remains robust and continues to grow.
In the U.S., demand is still below 2019 pre-COVID levels, and we believe there will be a continued recovery. As supply remains constrained and demand continues to rebound, we maintain a bullish outlook toward the refining environment as we look into 2023. Our third quarter results reflect the team's operational and commercial execution as we focused on delivering products for consumers in this very tight market. In our refining segment, we ran near full rates while maintaining our steadfast commitment to safely operating our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate.
In the fourth quarter, we're currently running our system at full utilization, except for the planned maintenance activity we have occurring given our back of the year weighted turnaround schedule. Aside from the refining business, I want to point out that our Midstream segment earnings continue to grow. In the third quarter, our adjusted EBITDA was up nearly 9% year over year in midstream. We've been executing strategic capital investments, fostering a low-cost culture and optimizing the portfolio, including advancing several organic growth projects in the Permian Basin.
The strength of these cash flows supports MPLX's decision to increase its quarterly distribution by 10%. Based on this level, MPC will receive $2 billion of distribution from MPLX annually. We've received questions regarding the structure of MPLX and whether MPC will acquire the outstanding public unit. So we want to restate what we said in the past.
MPLX is a strategic part of MPC's portfolio, its current pace of cash distributions to MPC is $2 billion per year, and we expect that to continue growing. MPLX has continued to demonstrate resilient through-cycle earnings and growing cash flows. As MPLX pursues its growth opportunities, we expect the value of this strategic partnership will continue to be enhanced, and we do not plan to roll up MPLX. Switching to capital allocation, we believe MPC's current capital allocation priorities are optimal for our shareholders.
In early 2000, we shared our three strategic areas of focus. They have become part of MPC's DNA embedded in our unwavering commitment to increase profitability, have the best through-cycle cash flow generation and drive a long-term value creation. As we focus on strengthening the competitive position of our assets, in September, we closed on our Martinez Renewables joint venture with Neste. Construction is well underway, and we expect Phase 1 mechanical completion by year-end.
We anticipate the conversion to result in a 60% reduction of the facility's Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, 70% lower total criteria air pollutants and 1 billion gallons of water saved annually. If you haven't had a chance yet, we invite you to go to the Sustainability section of our website and learn more about the ways we are challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann.
This quarter's results were adjusted to exclude three items: a $549 million noncash pre-tax gain related to the contribution of our refining assets to the Martinez Renewables JV, a $509 million noncash gain related to an MPLX third-party contract reclassification and a $28 million LIFO inventory charge. Adjusted EBITDA was $6.8 billion for the quarter and cash flow from operations, excluding unfavorable working capital changes was just under $4.5 billion. During the quarter, we returned $285 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased $3.9 billion of our shares. Slide 7 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the second quarter of 2022 to the third quarter of 2022.
Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $2.3 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by refining and marketing as the blended crack spread was down approximately $10 per barrel, reflecting a 25% quarterly decline. The tax rate for the third quarter was 22%, resulting in a tax provision of $1.4 billion. The tax rate is similar to last quarter due to the refining and marketing representing a larger component of total earnings.
We saw margins decline sequentially across all three regions. Capture was 97%, reflecting a strong result from our commercial team in a volatile global market. Operating expenses were higher in the third quarter. Energy costs were approximately $0.15 per barrel higher in the third quarter, driven by higher natural gas prices.
Additionally, we recorded a nonrecurring multiyear property tax assessment of $0.13 per barrel in the third quarter, which we will continue to pursue recovery. We believe the actions we have taken to bring our structural operating cost down to approximately $5 per barrel are sustainable. The cost increases we have seen year-to-date have almost entirely been driven by higher energy costs. Turning to Slide 9, which provides an overview of our refining and marketing margin capture this quarter.
Overall, we continue to focus on identifying and efficiently executing high-return projects to drive further growth for our midstream business. As Mike mentioned earlier, the growth of MPLX's earnings supported its decision to increase its quarterly distribution by 10% to $0.775 per share and MPC expects to receive $2 billion in cash from MPLX on an annual basis. MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio and as MPLX grows its free cash flow we believe it will have the capacity to return capital to its unitholders. Slide 11 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter, operating cash flow excluding changes in working capital, was just under $4.5 billion in the quarter.
We have completed our $15 billion share repurchase commitment, utilizing the proceeds from the Speedway divestiture at an average price of $78, ahead of our commitment of no later than the end of 2022. As you will see today, when our quarterly financials, the 10-Q was published, we were able to complete that early in the month of October. We intend to begin repurchase against our $5 billion outstanding authorization in November, now that our financials are public. On Slide 13, I'd like to walk you through our financial priorities, sustaining capital.
On Slide 14, we highlight the strength of MPC's balance sheet. We continue to manage our balance sheet through an investment-grade credit profile. At the end of our third quarter, MPC stand-alone gross debt to capital ratio is 21% which is under our target of a 25% to 30% gross debt-to-capital ratio. MPLX has a leverage ratio of 3.5 times debt to EBITDA under its target of four times.
As a reminder, natural gas has historically represented approximately 15% of operating costs. Our natural gas sensitivity is approximately $330 million of annual EBITDA for every dollar change per MMBtu. This equates to a sensitivity of approximately $0.30 per barrel of cost. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter.
Corporate costs are expected to be $170 million representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area. In closing, we will continue to execute on our three strategic pillars, strengthening the competitive performance of our assets, fostering a low-cost culture and improving our commercial performance. We are committed to position MPC as a reliable and efficient energy provider with new investments focused on high-return opportunities supporting the company's evolution, which will position it to lead in an energy diverse future. We will stay steadfast in our plan to position MPC as the refiner investment of choice, striving to deliver superior cash returns regardless of market conditions, and while ensuring we safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate.",29.0,Medium
MPC,2022,4,"Toni Townes-Whitley will be joining our board in March, bringing tremendous experience with her most recent executive position at Microsoft, as well as her board experience on the NASDAQ and PNC boards. Also like to recognize Christine Breves, who was appointed as a new independent director of MPLX in November, and recently served as CFO for U.S. Steel. As we look back at 2022, we've delivered on our strategic commitments.
Full-year cash provided by operating activities was just over $16 billion on a consolidated basis, and over $13 billion, excluding MPLX, reflecting our improving operating and commercial execution. Our commitment to safe and reliable operations resulted in refining utilization of 96%. And our team's dynamic responses to volatile product markets delivered strong commercial performance, resulting in a 98% full-year capture. Our focus on fostering a low-cost culture enable us to sustain our previously achieved $1.5 billion of structural cost reduction throughout the year.
MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio. And as MPLX grows its free cash flow, we believe we will continue to have the capacity to increase its capital return to unit holders. In 2022, we return nearly $12 billion through share repurchases, bringing the total repurchases to almost $17 billion since May of 2021. In addition, we increased MPC's dividend 30% to $0.75 per quarter.
Executing on our operating, commercial and financial objectives, combined with a strong macroenvironment, led to total shareholder returns of 87% for MPC in 2022. Before Maryann goes through the results for the quarter, we wanted to share our outlook on the macroenvironment and the financial priorities for 2023. Our outlook remains bullish for '23 supported by the nearly 4 million barrels per day of refining capacity that has come offline globally in the last couple of years. Demand for transportation fuels we manufacture remains robust.
We've seen recovery in demand across all our products since coming out of the pandemic. And we anticipate further recovery in 2023, particularly as we expect consumers to adjust consumption patterns to lower retail fuel prices. Uncertainties remain around the pace and impact of China's recovery, the magnitude of a potential US or global recession, and the impact of Russian product sanctions. But despite these unknowns, we believe that the current supply constraints and growing demand will support strong refining margins in '23.
Our financial priorities remain unchanged. These includes, first, sustaining capital. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operating our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees, and support the communities in which we operate. Second, our dividend.
We are committed to the dividend which we increased 30% at the end of last year and intend to evaluate at least annually. And as we repurchase shares, the reduction in the share count increases the ability to support future dividend growth. Third, growth capital. We believe this is a return on and return of capital business.
We've been through a progressive change over the last few years and remain focused on ensuring the competitiveness of our assets as we progress through the energy evolution. We will invest capital where we believe there are attractive returns. In traditional refining, we're focused on investments that enhance the competitiveness of our assets. In the low-carbon area, investment at this time is primarily associated with the completion of the Martinez Renewables project, as well as a project at our LA refinery that will improve energy efficiency and lower facility emissions.
Our goal is to be the investment of choice in the refining space, generating the most through cycle cash flow, creating value through strategic deployment of capital, and delivering superior returns to our shareholders. We also challenged ourselves to lead in sustainable energy by setting meaningful targets to reduce GHG emissions, methane emissions, and freshwater intensity, targets which we believe we can demonstrate a tangible path to accomplish. As we innovate for the future, Phase 1 of our Martinez Renewables fuel facilities progressing start-up activities, marking a significant milestone in our sustainable energy goals. The facility is on track to reach full Phase 1 production capacity of 260 million gallons per year of renewable fuels by the end of the first quarter 2023.
Pretreatment capabilities are expected to come online in the second half of '23, which will enable the facility to ramp up to its full expected capacity of 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023. At Dickinson, we've optimized operations to be able to bringing in more advantage feedstocks, lowering the carbon intensity of the fuels we produce. We've enhanced our position in the renewables value chain through our pretreatment facilities in Beatrice and Cincinnati. We'll continue to look for opportunities leveraging the strategic partnerships we're cultivating with Neste and ADM.
This excludes a $176 million LIFO inventory benefit, as well as $60 million gain related to the Speedway transactions. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.8 billion for the quarter, and cash flow from operations, excluding unfavorable working capital changes, was $4.4 billion. During the quarter, we returned $351 million to shareholders through dividend payments, and repurchased over $1.8 billion of our shares. Slide 7 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA, as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the third quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2022.
Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $1 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by refining and marketing, as the blended crack spread was down over $5 per barrel, reflecting a 20% quarterly decline. Corporate expenses were higher in the fourth quarter driven by a retroactive operating tax assessments for prior periods. We intend to pursue recovery of these multiyear tax assessments.
In addition, corporate includes special compensation expenses, which also affected our refining and marketing and midstream segments. We do not anticipate that these costs will structurally impact future corporate cost. The tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22%, resulting in a tax provision of nearly $1 billion, and the full-year tax rate was 22%. Moving to our segment results, slide 8 provides an overview of our refining and marketing segments.
Like many in the industry, several of our refineries were impacted by winter storm Elliott at the end of December, primarily in our Gulf Coast in Mid-Con regions. Most of our assets were back online after a short period, and we have not seen structural issues. The crude throughput impact was approximately 4 million barrels, which reduced our crude capacity utilization for the fourth quarter by roughly 2%. Looking to January, we anticipate impacts to throughput of 3.5 million barrels, which is reflected in our guidance for the first quarter of 2023.
Due to lower throughputs in the quarter, refining operating costs per barrel were roughly flat in the fourth quarter at $5.62 per barrel as compared to the third quarter. Our full-year refining operating costs per barrel is $5.41. When we compare to 2021 refining operating costs per barrel of $5.02, this increase can be entirely attributed to higher energy costs. We believe the actions we have taken to reduce our structural operating costs are sustainable.
Slide 9 provides an overview of our refining and marketing capture this quarter, which was 109%. Our commercial teams executed effectively in a volatile market, light product margin tailwinds improved secondary product prices and favorable inventory impacts all benefited capture. We do not expect all of these tailwinds to be repeatable. And in particular, we would expect the inventory impacts to reverse in the first quarter.
As our strategic pillar indicates we have been committed to improving our commercial performance and we believe that the capabilities we have built over the last 18 months will provide a sustainable advantage. Historically, we communicated a captured target of 95%. But over the last few years, the baseline has moved through our commercial efforts closer to 100%. We believe we have built capabilities that will provide incremental value beyond what we have realized to date and will produce results that can be seen in our financials.
Slide 10 show the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the third quarter of 2022. Our midstream segment delivered resilient fourth-quarter results. We did see lower EBITDA, primarily due to impacts associated with lower NGL prices. This quarter MPLX distributions contributed $502 million in cash flow to MPC.
Slide 11 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was $4.4 billion in the quarter. Working capital was a $72 million headwind for the quarter, driven mostly by declining crude prices offset by benefits from inventory impacts. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $1.3 billion this quarter.
We saw consistent spending in refining in the fourth quarter as work progress on the Martinez Renewables fuel facility conversion and the STAR project at Galveston Bay. While not reflected in the 2022 capital spend, due to the timing of the JV close, the 50% reimbursement from Neste for Martinez capital spend was received and reflected in overall cash flows in the third quarter. MPC returned nearly $2.2 billion via share repurchase and dividends during the quarter. We began using the incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization in November.
For the full year, we returned $13.2 billion out of $17.7 billion of our 2022 cash from operations, excluding working capital impacts, representing a 75% payout. This was partially enabled by our commitment to complete our $15 billion capital return program. The outstanding purchase authorization of $7.6 billion, which includes the incremental $5 billion approval, demonstrates our commitment to returning capital. At the end of the fourth quarter, MPC had approximately $11.8 billion in cash and short-term investments.
Slide 12 provides their capital investment plan for 2023, which reflects our continuing focus on strict capital discipline. MPC's investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals approximately $1.3 billion. The plan includes $1.25 billion for the refining and marketing segment, of which approximately $350 million or roughly 30% is related to maintenance and regulatory compliance. Our growth capital plan is approximately $900 million split between low carbon and traditional projects.
Within low carbon $150 million is allocated for completion of the Martinez conversion. We are also executing a project at our Los Angeles refinery, which will improve energy efficiency and lower facility emissions. This is a multiyear project. In 2023, we expect associated capital spending to be $150 million.
And we have allocated $50 million to smaller projects focused on emerging opportunities. Within traditional refining, $150 million is associated with the completion of the STAR project. $200 million is focused on smaller projects targeted at enhancing the yields of our refineries, improving energy efficiency, and lowering our cost. In marketing, we plan to spend $150 million for projects that focus on enhancing and expanding the platform for our Marathon and ARCO brands.
This morning, MPLX also announced their 2023 capital investment plan of $950 million. Their plan includes approximately $800 million of growth capital and $150 million of maintenance capital. The capital spending plan focuses on adding new gas processing plants and smaller investments targeted at expansion and debottlenecking of existing assets to meet customer demand. Turning to guidance, Slide 13, we provide our first-quarter outlook.
We are seeing the benefits from lower energy costs in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Con regions. But given the majority of our turnaround activity is heavily weighted to the Gulf Coast, our expectations of flat operating costs quarter to quarter is driven by our West Coast exposure, where we have not seen a decline in energy costs recently. As we look into 2023, we anticipate our operating costs per barrel would decline and trend toward a more normalized level as we complete this turnaround and project activity. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter.
Thanks, Maryann. In summary, we believe solid execution of our three strategic pillars remains foundational. Similar to what we've achieved with cost reductions and portfolio, we believe the improvements we've made to our commercial and operational execution have driven structural sustainable benefits, which will enable us to capture opportunities, irrespective of the market environment. Our goal is to position MPC as the refiner investment of choice, generating the most cash through cycle, and delivering superior returns to our shareholders with our steadfast commitment to returning capital.",29.0,Medium

Thank you, Brett. We're off to a fast start in fiscal 2022 with Microsoft Cloud quarterly revenue surpassing $20 billion for the first time, up 36% year over year. The case for digital transformation has never been more urgent or more clear. Digital technology is a deflationary force in an inflationary economy.

Coles, one of Australia's largest retailers chose Teams to bring two-way communications to more than 120,000 frontline employees. And Chevron, H&M, Lululemon, and St. Jude all turn to our premium Microsoft 365 E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice, and analytics. Now on to Windows. Earlier this month, we launched Windows 11th, the biggest update to our operating system in a decade.
And also have massive opportunity to create a new class of applications that take advantage of the edge and AI capabilities in Windows coupled with cloud. And Windows 11 is also the most open platform. It's pioneering new store commerce models and policies, with both Amazon and Epic Games are bringing their marketplaces to the Microsoft Store. Now on to security. Cybersecurity is the No.
1 threat facing businesses today. Our goal is to help every organization strengthen its defense through the zero trust architecture built on end-to-end solutions that span all clouds and all platforms. We analyze over 24 trillion signals across email, endpoints, and identities each day and translate this intelligence into innovative features to protect our customers. We have prevented more than 70 billion attacks over the past year alone.
We now have nearly 650,000 customers using our security solutions, up 50% year over year. And businesses like HCA Healthcare and Siemens switched to our security solutions to protect their endpoints. In identity, Azure Active Directory now has more than 500 million monthly active users and we have seen usage of third-party apps increase 1.5 times year over year. And the future of security is passwordless. Nearly 240 million users have adopted passwordless login to date and consumers can now completely remove passwords from their personal Microsoft accounts.
In our commercial business, customers continue to choose the Microsoft Cloud. We, again, saw healthy growth in our Azure consumption-based business and increased usage across products such as Teams and Power Platform, as Satya reflected in his comments. In our on-premises business, annuity performance in Office and Server benefited from a greater than expected mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. And in LinkedIn, the talent solutions business continued to benefit from an improved job market. In our consumer business, Windows OEM performance was better than expected in a growing PC market despite ongoing supply chain constraints.
Against the strong prior-year comparable, commercial bookings grew 11% and 14% in constant currency, driven by a consistent execution across new, add-on, and renewal sales motions. This quarter growth was impacted by fewer large long-term Azure contracts, which were unpredictable in their timing. As a result, commercial remaining performance obligation increased 28% and 29% in constant currency to $137 billion with a roughly equivalent split between revenue that we recognized within and the portion beyond the next 12 months. And our annuity mix increased two points year over year to 95%. Microsoft Cloud revenue grew 36% and 34% in constant currency to $20.7 billion, ahead of expectations.
Our capital investments, including both new data center regions and expansion in existing regions continue to be based on significant customer demand and usage signals. Cash flow from operations was $24.5 billion, increasing 27% year over year, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $18.7 billion, up 30% year over year. This quarter, other income and expense was $286 million, higher than anticipated, primarily driven by net gains on investments.
As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was approximately 16%. And finally, we returned $10.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now, before we turn to our outlook, I'd like to provide a couple of reminders. First, the outlook we give, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S.
dollar basis. Second, my remarks for the next quarter do not include the impact from the Nuance acquisition, which we now expect to close by the end of Q2 or early Q3. With that, let's move to our second-quarter outlook. In our commercial business, our differentiated market position, compelling solution portfolio, and consistent execution should drive another strong quarter.
Commercial bookings growth should again be healthy, but impacted by modest growth in the Q2 expiry base and the normal quarterly volatility from large long-term Azure contracts previously discussed. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage could decrease roughly two points year over year, excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate previously discussed. Q2 gross margin percentage will increase roughly two points, driven by continued improvement across our cloud services and site revenue mix shift to Azure. Longer-term, we expect the Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage to be impacted by revenue mix shift to Azure, increased usage of our Microsoft Cloud services, and ongoing strategic investments to support our customers' success. And on a dollar basis, we expect capital expenditures to be roughly in line with last quarter as we continue to invest to support growing demand. Now the FX.
And in enterprise services, we expect revenue growth to be in the high single digits. In more personal computing, we expect revenue between $16.35 billion and $16.75 billion. Despite ongoing supply chain constraints, OEM revenue should grow low to mid-teens, including six points of impact from the $210 billion Windows 11 deferral that shifted revenue from Q1 to Q2. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive low double-digit growth. In Surface, we expect revenue to decline single digits as we continue to work through supply chain uncertainty, particularly in our premium devices.
In search and news advertising ex TAC, we expect revenue growth in the low- to mid-20s. If supply chain uncertainty reduces advertising budgets, our results would be negatively impacted. And in gaming, on a high prior-year comparable that included the launch of our new consoles and strength across Xbox content and services, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits. Console sales will continue to be impacted by supply chain uncertainty.
And in Xbox content services, we expect revenue growth in the mid-teens with strong engagement on the Xbox platform in a holiday quarter that will include several AAA title launches. Now, back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $17 billion to $17.2 billion, and operating expenses of $12.7 billion to $12.8 billion. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. And finally, we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be approximately 17%.
In closing, we are off to a strong start in FY '22, with tremendous opportunity to drive sustained long-term revenue growth. We remain focused on growing high-value users across our differentiated Microsoft cloud offerings and delivering exciting new consumer experiences with Windows 11, Surface, and our Xbox gaming platform as we enter the holiday season. Our consistent approach to investing for these and other future opportunities, while continuing to deliver solid operating performance, will drive strong results throughout FY '22 and beyond. Now, Brett, let's go to Q&A.",15.0,Low

We're extending our infrastructure to the 5G network edge, helping operators and enterprises create new business models and deliver ultra-low latency services closer to the end user. AT&T, for example, is bringing together its 5G network with our cloud services to help General Motors deliver next-generation connected vehicle solutions to drivers. Our Azure Arc customer base has tripled year over year. We're now helping thousands of organizations, from BP to Rabobank, unify their on-premises, hybrid, and multi-cloud infrastructure.
More broadly, we continue to see strong usage across our Cognitive Services, with over 30 million hours of speech transcribed last quarter, up nearly two times compared to a year ago. Now to developers.  From GitHub to Visual Studio to Azure PaaS services, we have the most popular tools to help every developer going from idea to code and code to cloud. As companies prioritize embedding security into their developers' workflow, we're investing across GitHub to secure open source. Increasingly, every DevSecOps workflow will start with GitHub Advanced Security, and we're seeing strong demand from both digital natives like Afterpay and Mercari, as well as established companies like 3M and Bosch.
Across Dynamics 365, we continue to take share as companies turn to our expanding portfolio of business applications to address these and other challenges. With Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces, we are creating a new software category to help organizations manage physical operations across diverse industries, from real estate to retail, to factories, and construction. Companies like Chipotle and Home Depot are relying on our new Customer Experience Platform to take control of their data, connecting customer touchpoints to deliver more personalized experiences. Daimler Trucks North America is using Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights to pre-empt supply chain issues.
And we're expanding our opportunity with Teams Essentials, the first stand-alone Teams offering specifically designed to meet the needs of small businesses. It's early days, but we're already encouraged by strong demand. With Microsoft Viva, we're creating a new employee experience category, combining communications, knowledge, learning, resources, and insights to help people feel connected to the company's mission and culture. Now broadly available, Viva is being used by more than 1,000 paid customers, including Blum, Nationwide, and REI, to help address challenges like employee burnout and retention.
Over the past 12 months, our total advertising revenue, inclusive of LinkedIn, surpassed $10 billion ex-TAC. And with our acquisition of Xandr, we will bring to market new advertising solutions that combine our deep audience understanding and customer base with Xandr's large-scale, data-driven platforms. Now on to security. Cybercrime is the number one threat facing every business today.
Our aim is to help organizations implement a comprehensive ""zero trust"" architecture that protects people, devices, applications, and data holistically across their heterogeneous cloud and client environments. We protect our customers in two interconnected ways: first, we incorporate security by design into every product we built; and, second, we deliver advanced end-to-end cross-cloud, cross-platform security solutions, which integrate more than 50 different categories across security, compliance, identity, device management, and privacy, informed by more than 24 trillion threat signals we see each day. Among analysts, we are a leader in more than -- more security categories, now 19, than any other provider. Our multicloud, multiplatform innovation is driving growth.
Across commercial and consumer, more than 1 billion monthly active users now rely on Microsoft account to securely access their favorite products and services with just one login. More than 15,000 customers now use our cloud-native SIEM, Microsoft Sentinel, to stop threats before they happen, up over 70% year over year. And all-up, the number of customers that use our advanced security solutions accelerated this quarter to over 715,000. More than half have four or more workloads, up 75% year over year, underscoring our end-to-end differentiation.
As noted earlier, with the strengthening of U.S. dollar through the quarter, FX had no company or segment revenue growth impact, and minimal impact on COGS and operating expense growth.  Gross margin dollars increased 20%. Gross margin percentage was 67%, relatively unchanged year over year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly two points, driven primarily by the improvement in our cloud services noted earlier.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 19% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year over year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly two points, driven by improvement across all cloud services. Operating expense increased 13%, and operating income increased 24%. Next, the intelligent cloud segment.
With that, let's move to our third quarter outlook. First, FX. With the stronger U.S. dollar and based on current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately two points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately one point.
Continued strength in PC shipments, particularly in the commercial segment, should benefit Windows OEM despite ongoing supply chain constraints. We expect Windows OEM revenue growth in the high single-digits. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in the low double-digits. In Surface, revenue should grow in the mid-teens with strength from our premium devices.
In closing, digital technologies are increasingly essential to empowering every person and organization on the planet to achieve more, and we are well-positioned with innovative, high-value products. Our diverse, yet connected portfolio of solutions spans end markets, customer sizes, and business models uniquely enabling us to deliver long-term revenue and profit growth. With that, Brett, let's go to Q&A.",15.0,Low
MSFT,2022,3,"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Microsoft fiscal year 2022 third quarter earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Brett Iversen, general manager, investor relations.
The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's third quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.
Thank you, Brett. It was a record third quarter, driven by the continued strength of the Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $23 billion in revenue, up 32% year over year. Going forward, digital technology will be the key input that powers the world's economic output. Across the tech stack, we are expanding our opportunity and taking share as we help customers differentiate, build resilience, and do more with less.
And our acquisition of Minit adds new process mining capabilities, helping organizations identify bottlenecks and opportunities for operational efficiency. Now to Dynamics 365. Dynamics 365 is growing faster than the business applications market overall. For example, in a world of supply chain constraints, we are helping companies like Cracker Barrel and Unilever predict disruptions before they happen.
And we continue to help organizations like AIG, Grant Thornton, and Sage shift their on-premise virtualization services to the cloud with Azure Virtual Desktop. In consumer, Windows is key to curating our content and services to help every person with their everyday tasks from browsing and searching to learning and gaming, and shopping, all with security and privacy built-in. We are seeing strong engagement with nearly 500 million monthly active users of our personalized content feed, Microsoft Start. As usage continues to grow, we are seeing a flywheel emerge between content consumption and commerce as we generate new opportunities for content creators as well as advertisers.
And our browser, Microsoft Edge continues to gain share as we help people save money and shop securely. Now to security. Security is a top priority for every organization undergoing a digital transformation. To keep our customers secure, we build security by design into every product we sell.
And we deliver end-to-end solutions spanning security, compliance, identity, device management, and privacy across clouds and platforms informed by 24 trillion threat signals each day. This comprehensive capability has been critical during the recent world events, and we continue to disrupt cyberattacks and share threat intelligence with the Ukrainian government as well as other public sector agencies. Multi-cloud, multi-platform support is central to our approach. In security, we're the only cloud provider with native multi-cloud protection for the industry's top three cloud platforms.
In identity, we now provide permissions management across all clouds. Azure Active Directory is the undisputed market leader with more than 550 million monthly active users. In management, the number of Windows, Android, and iOS devices protected by Intune grew over 60% year over year. And we are expanding to new market segments with Microsoft Defender for Business, which will help keep small businesses secure.
This innovation and differentiation is driving our overall growth. All of the number of customers who trust our security solutions grew nearly 50% year over year to 785,000, including Citrix, Domino's Pizza, Fujitsu, Heineken, Petronas, who rely on us to protect their multi-cloud infrastructure. And we have over 15,000 partners in our security ecosystem, more than anyone else in the industry. Now on to gaming.
Azure gaming revenue fiscal year-to-date increased 66%. In closing, we are entering a new era where every company will become a digital company. Our portfolio of durable digital businesses and diverse business models built on a common tech stack position us well to capture the massive opportunities ahead. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.
As a result, revenue and EPS were negatively impacted by $302 million and $0.03 per share, respectively. Finally, the war in Ukraine. We suspended all new sales of our products and services in Russia. Revenue generated in Russia represents less than 1% of total company revenue, and we expect that it will decline significantly.
FX decreased total company revenue by three points, one point unfavorable to expectations decreased COGS by one point, in line with expectations, and decreased operating expense growth by two points, one point favorable to expectations. Gross margin dollars increased 18% and 21% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year over year to 68%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased approximately one point, driven primarily by improvement in our cloud services noted earlier. Operating expense increased 15% and 17% in constant currency, slightly lower than expected as investments that shifted to future quarters were partially offset by the inclusion of Nuance.
Dynamics revenue grew 22% and 25% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365. This grew 35% and 38% in constant currency, substantially faster than the market, although a bit lower than expected as we focus on stronger execution on our recent investments. LinkedIn revenue increased 34% and 35% in constant currency, with better-than-expected performance in Talent Solutions as well as continued strength in Marketing Solutions and record levels of engagement on the platform. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 19% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year over year.
Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly two points, driven by improvement across all cloud services. Operating expense increased 13% and 14% in constant currency, and operating income increased 19% and 23% in constant currency. Next, the intelligent cloud segment, which includes approximately four weeks of results from Nuance. Revenue was $19.1 billion, increasing 26% and 29% in constant currency.
The inclusion of Nuance professional services impacted the constant currency growth rate by one point. Segment gross margin dollars increased 24% and 27% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly one point year over year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly one point with improvements in Azure, partially offset by the sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expense increased 17% and 19% in constant currency, and operating income grew 29% and 33% in constant currency.
Cash flow from operations was $25.4 billion, increasing 14% as strong cloud billings and collections were partially offset by higher supplier payments related to hardware inventory builds as we manage continued uncertainty in the supply chain. Free cash flow was $20 billion, up 17%. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $174 million, lower than anticipated, driven by net losses on investments, including mark-to-market losses on our equity portfolio and net losses on foreign currency remeasurement. Equity market declines drove net investment losses this quarter compared to net investment gains last year, a negative two-point impact on year-over-year EPS growth.
Our effective tax rate was approximately 17%. And finally, we returned $12.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now before we turn to our outlook, a few reminders. First, FX.
Third, we anticipate the war in Ukraine to continue to impact our business in Q4 with a roughly $110 million impact on revenue and minimal impact on operating expenses. Next, we have taken into account the current impact of shutdowns in China in our outlook. However, extended production shutdowns that reach into May would further negatively impact our outlook across Windows OEM, Surface, and Xbox hardware. Finally, the outlook we give, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a USD basis.
With that context in place, let's turn to our Q4 outlook. In our largest quarter of the year. We expect our differentiated market position, customer demand across the solution portfolio, and consistent execution to drive another strong quarter of revenue growth. In Commercial bookings, a growing Q4 expiry base, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, and increased commitment to our platform should drive healthy growth against a strong prior year comparable.
In more personal computing, we expect revenue between $14.65 billion and $14.95 billion. As mentioned earlier, our guidance reflects the current constraints from the shutdowns in China, which had negatively impacted Q4 supply for OEM, Surface, and Xbox consoles. In Windows OEM, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, driven by the continued shift to a commercial-led PC market, where revenue per license is higher. In Windows Commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in the low double digits.
Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $16.6 billion to $16.8 billion and operating expense of $14.8 billion to $14.9 billion, resulting in another quarter of operating margin expansion, excluding the change in useful life. We expect other income and expense to be negative $50 million, reflecting FX remeasurement impact based on market conditions in April. Similar to the rest of our guidance, further equity and FX movements through Q4 are not reflected in this number.",15.0,Low
MSFT,2022,4,"Greetings, and welcome to the Microsoft fiscal year 2022 fourth-quarter earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Brett Iversen, vice president of investor relations. Thank you.
The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's fourth-quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.
From infrastructure and data to business applications and hybrid work, we provide unique differentiated value to our customers. Second, we will invest to take share and build new businesses and categories where we have long-term structural advantage. Lastly, we will manage through this period with an intense focus on prioritization and executional excellence in our own operations to drive operational leverage. With that, let me highlight our progress, starting with Azure.
Organizations in every industry continue to choose our cloud to align their IT investments with demand. We are seeing larger and longer-term commitments and won a record number of $100 million-plus and $1 billion-plus deals this quarter. We have more data center regions than any other provider, and we will launch 10 regions over the next year. Our new Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty helps public sector customers meet urgent compliance, security, and privacy requirements.
More than 400,000 people have subscribed since we made it generally available a month ago. And with our expanding portfolio of container services, organizations like H&M can build modern, more resilient cloud-native applications. All up, revenue from Azure container services increased by triple digits. Now on to Power Platform.
Now on to Dynamics 365. We are helping organizations digitize their customer experience, service, finance, and supply chain functions as we continue to outgrow the market in every category. Our new Microsoft Digital Contact Center Platform brings together Dynamics 365, Microsoft Teams as well as enterprise AI capabilities from Nuance to help customers like HP deliver omnichannel customer engagement. And new integrations between Dynamics 365 and Intelligent Order Management and Teams help people collaborate in the flow of work to overcome supply chain disruptions.
We are winning customers as we help organizations address their most pressing challenges. Pete's Coffee is modernizing its supply chain with our business applications. Carlsberg is standardizing its field service and customer service operations. And Visa switched to Dynamics 365 for both its sales and call center organizations.
One year in, we are seeing strong adoption of Windows 365 from organizations in every industry from Hamburg Commercial Bank and Kyndryl to LEGO Group and Schroders as they use cloud PCs to rapidly onboard new and temporary employees and speed M&A integration while reducing IT costs. Now on to security. As the rate and pace of threats continue to accelerate, security is the top priority for every organization. We provide comprehensive solutions that integrate more than 50 categories informed by more than 43 trillion signals each day, reducing cost and complexity.
We're taking share across all major categories we serve. All up, our security revenue increased 40%. We are the only cloud provider with protection for the top three cloud platforms, and we are seeing more and more customers turn to us to protect their multi-cloud, multi-platform infrastructure. Pearson VUE and Vodafone both chose our security stack to protect their digital estate across clouds.
And we're going further to help protect organizations. Our new Entra product family includes tools for permissions management, identity governance, and identity verification. And we now offer managed threat detection and response with Microsoft Security Experts, the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, for example, will use the service to supplement its own security operations. Now on to LinkedIn.
We once again saw record engagement among the more than 850 million members, a testament to how mission-critical the platform is to connect job seekers with jobs, learners with skills, and marketeers with buyers. We are seeing job candidates and employers alike prioritize skills to more efficiently find and source work. More than 40% of the companies on LinkedIn now rely on skills filters to identify candidates. LinkedIn Talent Solutions surpassed $6 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, up 39% year over year.
And LinkedIn Marketing Solutions surpassed $5 billion in annual revenue for the first time. We are a leader in B2B digital advertising, and we continue to see customers choose us for higher reach and ROI. More broadly, despite the current headwinds in the ad market, we are expanding our opportunity in advertising as we look toward the long term. We are creating a new monetization engine for the web, an alternative that offers marketeers and publishers more long-term viable ad solutions and supports consumer privacy and strong data governance.
And we partnered with Epic Games to make Fortnite available for free via the browser. Over 4 million people have streamed the game to date, including over 1 million who were new to our ecosystem. In closing, we are investing in sharpening our focus to help our customers during this critical moment and to capture the massive technological shifts underway. Our portfolio of best-of-category products and best-of-suite solutions, along with our durable business models, an intense focus on prioritization, and executional excellence, make me confident about our opportunity ahead in the coming year.
Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $51.9 billion, up 12% and 16% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.23 and increased 3% and 8% in constant currency. I'd like to start by discussing the impact of the macroeconomic environment on our results this quarter.
First, FX. The U.S. dollar strengthened throughout the quarter, creating an additional headwind beyond what we shared mid-quarter. As a result, for the full quarter, revenue and EPS were negatively impacted by $595 million and $0.04 per share, beyond our expectations shared in April.
Gross margin dollars increased 10% and 15% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased year over year to 68%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate and FX, gross margin percentage increased slightly as the improvement in cloud services noted earlier was partially offset by sales mix shift to cloud. Operating expense increased 14% and 16% in constant currency, driven by increased investments in cloud engineering, LinkedIn and Nuance. Opex growth included roughly two points from the decision to scale down operations in Russia, employee severance, and the impact from the Xandr acquisition, which closed in June.
Office commercial licensing was down 32% and 28% in constant currency, lower than expected, driven primarily by a lower mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. Office consumer revenue grew 9% and 12% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 15% to 59.7 million. Dynamics revenue grew 19% and 24% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 31% and 36% in constant currency, slightly below expectations due to lower-than-expected growth in new business even as our cloud growth continues to outpace the market. LinkedIn revenue increased 26% to 29% in constant currency, lower than expected as Marketing Solutions was impacted by the slowdown of advertising spend noted earlier.
Enterprise Services revenue grew 5% and 8% in constant currency, lower than expected, driven by declines in Microsoft Consulting Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15% and 19% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly three points year over year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly two points, driven by sales mix shift to Azure, partially offset by improvements in Azure margins. Operating expenses increased 20% and 22% in constant currency, including roughly seven points of impact from Nuance.
Free cash flow was $17.8 billion, up 9% year over year. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $47 million, primarily driven by net losses on investments, including mark-to-market losses on our equity portfolio. Equity market declines drove net investment losses this quarter compared to net investment gains last year, resulting in a negative three-point impact on EPS growth. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%.
And finally, we returned $12.4 billion to shareholders, up 19% year over year through share repurchases and dividends, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders to over $46 billion for the full fiscal year. Now moving to our outlook. My commentary for both the full year and next quarter does not include any impact from Activision, which we still expect to close by the end of the fiscal year. Let me start with some full-year commentary for FY '23.
First, effective at the start of FY '23, we are extending the depreciable useful life for server and network equipment assets in our cloud infrastructure from four to six years, which will apply to the asset balances on our balance sheet as of June 30, 2022, as well as future asset purchases. Investments in our software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment as well as advances in technology have resulted in lives extending beyond historical accounting useful lives. This change only impacts the timing of depreciation expense in the future for these assets. As a result, based on the outstanding balances as of June 30, we expect fiscal year '23 operating income to be favorably impacted by approximately $3.7 billion for the full fiscal year and approximately $1.1 billion in the first quarter.
FX should also decrease COGS and operating expense growth by two points. Now to our full-year business outlook based on the current macro environment. At every level of the company, we manage performance on a constant currency basis, as we have for many years. Therefore, with the FX volatility we have seen, I will comment on full year in constant currency and in U.S.
And in gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits, driven by declines in first-party content, partially offset by growth in Game Pass subscribers and consoles. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 12% and 14% in constant currency or to be between $14.9 billion and $15.1 billion and operating expense to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or to be between $13.3 billion and $13.4 billion.
Total company headcount is expected to continue to grow, with 11,000 hires expected to start in Q1, primarily in cloud engineering, LinkedIn, customer deployment, and commercial sales. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. And we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.",15.0,Low
MSFT,2023,1,"Greetings, and welcome to the Microsoft fiscal year 2023 first quarter earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Brett Iversen, vice president, investor relations.
The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's first-quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.
It helps them align their spend with demand and mitigate risk around increasing energy costs and supply chain constraints. We're also seeing more customers turn to us to build and innovate with infrastructure they already have. With Azure Arc, organizations like Wells Fargo can run Azure services, including containerized applications across on-premises, edge, and multi-cloud environments. We now have more than 8,500 Arc customers, more than double the number a year ago.
We are the platform of choice for customers' SAP workloads in the cloud, companies like Thabani, Munich Re's, Sodexo, Volvo Cars, all run SAP on Azure. We are the only cloud provider with direct and secure access to Oracle databases running an Oracle Cloud infrastructure, making it possible for companies like FedEx, GE, and Marriott to use capabilities from both companies. And with Azure Confidential Computing, we're enabling companies in highly regulated industries, including RBC, to bring their most sensitive applications to the cloud. Just last week, UBS said it will move more than 50% of its applications to Azure.
Now to data and AI. With our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform, we provide a complete data fabric, helping customers cut integration tax associated with bringing together siloed solutions. Customers like Mercedes-Benz are standardizing on our data stack to process and govern massive amounts of data. Cosmos DB is the go-to database powering the world's most demanding workloads at limitless scale.
And GitHub's developer-first ethos has never been stronger. More than 90 million people now use the service to build software for any cloud on any platform up three times. GitHub advanced security is helping organizations improve their security posture by bringing features directly into the developer's workflow. Toyota North America chose the offering this quarter to help its developers build and secure many of its most critical applications.
Power Automate has more than seven million monthly active users and is being used by companies like Brown-Forman, Komatsu, Mass, T-Mobile to digitize manual business processes and save thousands of hours of employee time. And we're going further with new AI-powered capabilities and power automate that turn natural language into advanced workflows. Now on to Dynamics 365. From customer experience and service to finance and supply chain, we continue to take share across all categories we serve.
For example, Lufthansa Cargo chose us to centralize customer information and related shipments. CBRE is optimizing its field service operations, gaining cost efficiencies. Darden is using our solutions to increase both guest frequency and spend at its restaurants. And Tillamook is scaling its growth and improving supply chain visibility.
Users interact with Teams 1,500 times per month on average. In a typical day, the average commercial user spends more time in Teams chat than they do in email, and the number of users who use four or more features within Teams increased over 20% year over year. Teams is becoming a ubiquitous platform for business process. Monthly active enterprise users running third party and custom applications within Teams increased nearly 60% year over year, and over 55% of our enterprise customers who use Teams today also buy Teams Rooms or Teams Phone.
Just like Outlook calendar orchestrates when people can meet and collaborate, Places will do the same for where. We also announced Teams Premium, addressing enterprise demands for advanced meeting features like additional security options and intelligent meeting recaps. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. Leaders in every industry from Fannie Mae and Land O'Lakes to Rabobank continue to turn to our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice, and analytics.
Accenture, for example, has deployed Windows 11 to more than 450,000 employees' PCs, up from just 25,000, seven months ago, and L'Oreal has deployed the operating system to 85,000 employees. Now to security. Security continues to be a top priority for every organization. We're the only company with integrated end-to-end tools spanning security, compliance, identity and device management, and privacy across all clouds and platforms.
More than 860,000 organizations across every industry from BP and Fuji Film to ING Bank, iHeartMedia, and Lumen Technologies now use our security solutions, up 33% year over year. They can save up to 60% when they consolidate our security stack, and the number of customers with more than four workloads have increased 50% year over year. More organizations are choosing both our XDR and cloud-native SIM to secure their entire digital estate. The number of E5 customers who also purchased Sentinel increased 44% year over year.
And as threats become more sophisticated, we are innovating to protect customers. New capabilities in Defender help secure the entire DevOps life cycle and manage security posture across clouds. And Entra now provides comprehensive identity governance for both on-premise and cloud-based user directories. Now on to LinkedIn.
And with our acquisition of EduBrite, they will also soon be able to earn professional certificates from trusted partners directly on the platform. We launched the next-generation sales navigator this quarter, helping sellers increase win rates and deal sizes by better understanding and evaluating customer interest. Finally, LinkedIn Marketing Solution continues to provide leading innovation and ROI in B2B digital advertising. More broadly, with Microsoft Advertising, we offer a trusted platform for any marketeer or advertiser looking to innovate.
And as we look toward the holidays, we offer the best value in gaming with Game Pass and Xbox Series S, nearly half of the Series S buyers are new to our ecosystem. In closing, in a world facing increasing headwinds, digital technology is the ultimate tailwind. And we're innovating across the entire tech stack to help every organization, while also focusing intensely on our operational excellence and execution discipline. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.
At a total company level, headcount grew 22% year over year, as we continue to invest in key areas just mentioned, as well as customer deployment. Headcount growth included roughly six points from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions, which closed last Q3 and Q4, respectively. Operating income increased 6% and 15% in constant currency, and operating margins decreased roughly two points year over year to 43%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins declined roughly four points year over year driven by sales mix shift to cloud, unfavorable FX impact, Nuance, and the lower Azure margin noted earlier.
Now to our segment results. Revenue from productivity and business processes was $16.5 billion and grew 9% and 15% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, with better-than-expected results in Office commercial and LinkedIn. Office commercial revenue grew 7% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 11% and 17% in constant currency, slightly better than expected, with the strong renewal execution noted earlier.
Dynamics revenue grew 15% and 22% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 24% and 32% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue increased 17% and 21% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected growth in talent solutions, partially offset by weakness in marketing solutions from the advertising trends noted earlier. Segment gross margin dollars increased 11% and 18% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point year over year. Excluding the impact of the latest change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by sales mix shift to cloud offerings.
Now to more personal computing. Revenue decreased slightly year over year to $13.3 billion and grew 3% in constant currency, in line with expectations overall, but with OEM and Surface weakness offset by upside in gaming consoles. Windows OEM revenue decreased 15% year over year. Excluding the impact from the Windows 11 deferral last year, revenue declined 20%, driven by PC market demand deterioration noted earlier.
Our data center investments continue to be based on strong customer demand and usage signals. Cash flow from operations was $23.2 billion, down 5% year over year, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, which were more than offset by a tax payment related to the transfer of intangible property completed in Q1 of FY '22. Free cash flow was $16.9 billion, down 10% year over year. Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations grew 2%, and free cash flow was relatively unchanged [indiscernible] year.
My commentary, for both the full year and next quarter, does not include any impact from AC division, which we still expect to close by the end of the fiscal year. First, FX. With the stronger US dollar and based on current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately five points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately three points. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly seven points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in productivity and business processes, six points in Intelligent cloud and three points in more personal computing.
We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be similar to last quarter on a constant currency basis. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-30s. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue to decline low to mid-single digits as Microsoft 365 subscription growth will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact. For LinkedIn, we expect continued strong engagement on the platform, although results will be impacted by a slowdown in advertising spend and hiring, resulting in mid to high single-digit revenue growth or low to mid-teens growth in constant currency.
Other income and expense should be roughly $100 million, as interest income is expected to more than offset interest expense. Further FX and equity movements through Q2 are not reflected in this number. And as a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. And we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%.
And finally, as a reminder, for Q2 cash flow, we expect to make a $2.4 billion cash tax payment related to the capitalization of R&D provision enacted in 2017 TCJA and effective as of July 1, 2022. Now some thoughts on the full fiscal year. First, FX. Based on current rates, we now expect a roughly five-point headwind to full-year revenue growth.
And FX should decrease COGS and operating expense growth by approximately three points. At the total company level, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth on a constant currency basis. Revenue will be driven by around 20% constant currency growth in our commercial business, driven by strong demand for our Microsoft cloud offerings. That growth will be partially offset by the increased declines we now see in the PC market.",15.0,Low
MSFT,2023,2,"The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's second-quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.
Thank you very much, Brett. I want to start with the context I shared with our employees last week on the changing environment and our priorities. As I meet with customers and partners, a few things are increasingly clear. Just as we saw customers accelerate their digital spend during the pandemic, we are now seeing them optimize that spend.
We also continue to lead with hybrid computing with Azure Arc. We now have more than 12,000 Arc customers, double the number a year ago, including companies like Citrix, Northern Trust, and PayPal. Now on to data. Customers continue to choose and implement the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform over the competition because of its comprehensiveness, integration, and lower cost.
And we are making it easier for anyone to streamline repetitive tasks, introducing new AI-powered features to turn natural language prompts into complex workflows. Now, on to business applications. Dynamics 365 is taking share as we help businesses digitize their service, finance, customer experience, and supply chain functions. For example, J&J, Pepsi-Cola Bottlers is moving from reactive to predictive field service.
Fuji Films is optimizing its operations. Investec is closing deals faster with conversational intelligence. Baylor Scott & White in Texas is using our digital contact center to enhance patient communications. And this quarter, we introduced our new supply chain platform, helping customers like iFit and Kraft Heinz apply AI to predict and mitigate disruptions.
All up, we continue to see organizations consolidate on Microsoft 365. 80% of our enterprise customers use five or more Microsoft 365 applications. And organizations across the private and public sector, including EY, IKEA, NTT Communications, Rio Tinto, as well as the state government of Virginia are increasingly choosing our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice, and analytics. Now, on to Windows.
While the number of PCs shipped declined during the quarter, returning to pre-pandemic levels, usage intensity of Windows continues to be higher than pre pandemic with time spent per PC up nearly 10%. Monthly active devices also reached an all-time high this quarter. And for commercial customers, Windows 11 adoption continues to grow because of its differentiated security and productivity value proposition. We're also seeing growth in cloud-delivered Windows with usage of Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop up by over two-thirds year over year.
Leaders in every industry from Campari and Grant Thornton U.K. to Nutrien and Woolworths are using cloud-delivered Windows, including more than 60% of the Fortune 500. Now, on to security. Over the past 12 months, our security business surpassed $20 billion in revenue as we help customers protect their digital estate across clouds and endpoint platforms.
We're the only company with integrated end-to-end tools spanning identity, security, compliance, device management, and privacy informed and trained on over 65 trillion signals each day. We are taking share across all major categories we serve. Customers are consolidating on our security stack in order to reduce risk, complexity, and cost. The number of organizations with four or more workloads increased over 40% year over year.
U.K. retailer Fraser Group, for example, consolidated from 10 security vendors to just Microsoft. Roku moved identity and access management to the cloud with Azure Active Directory. And Estella Pharma, Ferrovial, and University of Toronto all switched to Microsoft Sentinel because of our integrated XDR and SIM capabilities.
Over 80% of these members are from outside the United States. And as the members come to the platform to find and share professional knowledge and expertise, newsletter creation was up 10x year over year. Skills are the new currency and people are increasingly investing in their skill-building to keep up with their changing roles in industries. We offer more than 20,000 courses in 11 languages, and companies are also turning to a skills-based approach in place of degree or pedigree to identify qualified talent, with more than 45% of the hires on LinkedIn explicitly using skills data to fill their roles.
Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by reiterating Satya's thoughts on the changing environment and our priorities, which underpin the decisions communicated in last week's announcement. The resulting Q2 charge negatively impacted gross margin by $152 million, operating income by $1.2 billion, and earnings per share by $0.12. Our second quarter revenue was $52.7 billion, up 2% and 7% in constant currency.
was weaker than expected. Importantly, we continued to see share gains in areas such as data and AI, Dynamics, Teams, Security, and Edge. Commercial bookings increased 7% and 4% in constant currency, lower than expected. Consistent execution across our renewal sales motions, including strong recapture rates, and growth in Azure commitments on a high prior-year comparable were partially offset by the slowdown in growth of new stand-alone business noted earlier.
Sequential headcount growth was less than 1%. Year-over-year growth included roughly six points from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions, which closed last Q3 and Q4, respectively. Adjusted for the charge, operating margins decreased roughly two points year over year to 41%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins declined roughly four points, primarily driven by unfavorable FX impact, as well as a lower mix of OEM revenue.
Now, to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $17 billion and grew 7% and 13% in constant currency, in line with expectations when excluding the favorable FX impact noted earlier. Office Commercial revenue grew 7% and 14% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased 11% and 18% in constant currency, slightly better than expected with healthy renewal execution and ARPU growth as E5 momentum remains strong.
Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 31% and 38% in constant currency. As noted earlier, growth continued to moderate, particularly in December, and we exited the quarter with Azure constant-currency growth in the mid-30s. In our per-user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 16% to over 241 million seats with impact from the slowdown in growth of new business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 2% and increased 2% in constant currency, with continued hybrid demand offset by weakness in transactional licensing.
Operating income grew 7% and 15% in constant currency as roughly seven points of favorable impact of the change in accounting estimate was offset by approximately seven points of unfavorable impact from the Q2 charge. Now, to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.2 billion, decreasing 19% and 16% in constant currency, below expectations driven by Surface, Windows Commercial, and search. Windows OEM revenue decreased 39% year over year, in line with expectations.
Our Edge browser gained more share than expected this quarter. The Xandr acquisition contributed roughly six points of benefit. And in gaming, revenue declined 13% and 9% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Xbox hardware revenue declined 13% and 9% in constant currency.
Xbox content and services revenue declined 12% and 8% in constant currency, given the strong first-party content last year. Segment gross margin dollars declined 29% and 24% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly seven points year over year, driven by lower device gross margin and sales mix shift to lower-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 6% and 9% in constant currency, including roughly six points of impact from the Q2 charge noted earlier and three points of impact from the Xandr acquisition. Operating income decreased 47% and 40% in constant currency, including roughly six points of unfavorable impact from the Q2 charge noted earlier.
Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $6.8 billion to support cloud demand. Cash paid for PP&E was $6.3 billion. Cash flow from operations was $11.2 billion, down 23% year over year as strong cloud billings and collections were more than offset by a tax payment related to the TCJA capitalization of R&D provision, as well as higher employee and supplier payments.
Free cash flow was $4.9 billion, down 43% year over year. Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations declined 7% and free cash flow declined 16%. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $60 million, lower than anticipated, driven by a mark-to-market loss on a forward share purchase agreement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%.
First, FX. Based on current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately three points, COGS growth by one point, and operating expense growth by two points. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly four points of negative impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes, three points in Intelligent Cloud, and two points in More Personal Computing. In our Consumer business, Windows OEM and devices will see continued declines as the PC market returns to pre-pandemic levels.
As I noted earlier, we exited Q2 with Azure growth in the mid-30s in constant currency. And from that, we expect Q3 growth to decelerate roughly four to five points in constant currency. FX impact in Azure is about one point more than at the segment level. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low single digits as demand for our hybrid solutions will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact.
And in Enterprise Services, revenue should decline low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft Consulting Services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $11.9 billion to $12.3 billion. Windows OEM revenue should decline in the mid- to high 30s, in line with the PC market. We expect Q3 PC units to be similar to pre-pandemic levels.
As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains and losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And finally, as a reminder, for Q3 cash flow, we expect to make a $1.2 billion cash tax payment related to the TCJA capitalization of R&D provision. Now, some thoughts on H2 and the full year.
Finally, we remain committed to operational excellence, aligning cost and growth, investing in our customer success, and leading the AI platform wave. As a result, when excluding the Q2 charge and favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate, we expect full-year operating margins to be down roughly one point in constant currency and roughly two points in USD, even with the headwinds from materially lower OEM revenue and higher energy costs. In the first half of the year, over 70% of our revenue came from our Commercial business and over 70% of that from Microsoft Cloud. We have a resilient foundation and durable growth markets where we are gaining share.",15.0,Low

Starting with Gaming, revenue was $3.1 billion, was up 11% sequentially and up 85% from a year earlier. Demand remained exceptionally strong, outpacing supply. We are now four quarters into Ampere architecture product cycle for gaming and it continues to be our best ever.
We also announced general availability of NVIDIA Fleet Command, our managed edge AI Software-as-a-Service offering. Fleet Command helps companies solve the problem of securely deploying and managing AI applications across thousands of remote locations, combining the efficiency and simplicity of central management with the cost performance and data sovereignty benefits of real-time processing at the edge.
We are working through the regulatory process, although some Arm licensees have expressed concerns and objected to the transaction. And discussions with regulators are taking longer than initially thought. We are confident in the deal and that regulators should recognize the benefits of the acquisition to Arm, its licensees and the industry.
Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin of 64.8% for the second quarter was up 600 basis points from a year earlier, reflecting the absence of certain Mellanox acquisition-related costs. GAAP gross margins was up 70 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margins was 66.7%, up 70 basis points from a year earlier and up 50 basis points sequentially, reflecting higher ASPs within desktop, GeForce, GPUs and continued growth in high end Ampere architectured products, partially offset by a mix shift within data center. Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.94, up 276% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.04, up 89% from a year earlier, adjusting for the 4-to-1 stock split effective this quarter, Q2 cash flow from operations was a record $2.7 billion.
GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65.2% and 67% respectively, plus or minus 30 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.96 billion and $1.37 billion respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are both expected to be an expense of approximately $60 million, excluding gains and losses on equity securities. GAAP and non-GAAP taxes are supposed to be expected 11%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $200 million to $225 million.",13.0,Low

All in, we announced over 160 new laptop designs for NVIDIA and tier architecture RTX 30 Series GPUs. These include a number of studio systems targeting the tens of millions of creators driving the future of design, innovation, and virtual world. In addition to supporting the new RTX 30 Series GPUs, Studio laptops future support for NVIDIA software with Omniverse, Tundus, and Broadcast. Availability of our gaming products in the channel remains low.
Q4 revenue was $125 million, declined 7% sequentially and 14% from the year-ago quarter. Fiscal year revenue of $566 million was up 6%. We have just started shipments of our Orion-based product platform and expect to return to sequential revenue growth in Q1 with more meaningful inflection in the second half of the fiscal year and momentum building into calendar 2023. I will now hand it over to Jensen to provide more color on this morning's automotive news.
Thanks, Colette. Earlier today, we announced a partnership with Jaguar Land Rover to jointly develop and deliver fleets of software-defined cars. Starting in 2025, all new Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles will have next-generation automated driving systems, plus AI-enabled software and services built on the NVIDIA DRIVE platform. DRIVE Orin will be the AI computer brain running our DRIVE AV and DRIVE IX software.
And the DRIVE Hyperion sensor network will be the central nervous system. This new vehicle architecture will enable a wide spectrum of active safety, automated driving, and parking systems. Inside the vehicle, the system will deliver AI features, including driver and occupant monitoring and advanced visualization of the vehicles surroundings. We are very much looking forward to partnering with Thierry Bollore, JLR's CEO, and his team to reinvent the future of luxury cars.
Meta Platforms unveils its new AI supercomputer research, SuperCluster, with over 6,000 A100 GPUs moved to an NVIDIA -- Meta's early benchmarks showed its system can train large natural language processing models 3x faster and run computer vision jobs 20x faster than the prior system. In a second phase later this year, the system will expand to 16,000 GPUs that Meta believes will deliver 5x of mixed precision AI performance. In addition to performance at scale, Meta cited extreme reliability, security, privacy, and flexibility to handle a wide range of AI models as its key criteria for the system. We continue to broaden the reach and ease the adoption of NVIDIA AI into vertical industries.
Across the board, we are excited about the traction we are seeing with our new software business models, including NVIDIA AI, NVIDIA Omniverse, and NVIDIA DRIVE. We are still early in the software revenue ramp. Our pipelines are building as customers across the industry seek to accelerate their pace of adoption and innovation with NVIDIA. Now, let me turn it back over to Jensen for some comments on Arm.
We appreciated the regulatory concerns. For over a year, we worked closely with SoftBank and Arm to explain our vision for Arm and reassure regulators that NVIDIA would be a worthy steward of the Arm ecosystem. We gave it our best shot, but the headwinds were too strong, and we could not give regulators the comfort they needed to approve our deal. NVIDIA's work in accelerated computing and our overall strategy will continue as before.
Thanks, Jensen. We're going to turn to our P&L and our outlook. For the discussion of the rest of the P&L, please refer to the CFO commentary published earlier today on our Investor Relations lean. Let me turn to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2023.
Non-GAAP tax rate are expected to be 11% and 13%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $350 million to $400 million.

Starting with Gaming. Revenue of $3.6 billion rose 6% sequentially and 31% year on year, powered by the GeForce RTX 30 Series product cycle. Since launching in the fall of 2020, the RTX 30 Series has been our best Gaming product cycle ever. The gaming industry has grown tremendously with 100 million new PC gamers added in the past two years according to Newzoo.
However, we started seeing softness in parts of Europe related to the war in the Ukraine and parts of China due to the COVID lockdowns. As we expect some ongoing impact as we prepare for a new architectural transition later in the year, we are projecting Gaming revenue to decline sequentially in Q2. Channel inventory has nearly normalized and we expect it to remain around these levels in Q2. The extent in which cryptocurrency mining contributed to Gaming demand is difficult for us to quantify with any reasonable degree of precision.
The reduced pace of increase in Ethereum network hash rate likely reflects lower mining activity on GPUs. We expect a diminishing contribution going forward. Laptop Gaming revenue posted strong sequential and year-on-year growth, driven by the ramp of the NVIDIA RTX 30 Series lineup. With this year's spring refresh and ahead of the upcoming back-to-school season, there are now over 180 laptop models featuring RTX 30 Series GPUs and our energy-efficient thin and light Max-Q technologies, up from 140 at this time last year.
And PepsiCo is using Omniverse digital twins to improve the efficiency and environmental sustainability of the supply chain. Omniverse is also expanding our GPU sales pipeline, driving higher end and multiple GPU configurations. The Omniverse ecosystem continues to rapidly expand with third-party developers in the robotics, industrial automation, 3D design and rendering ecosystems developing connections to Omniverse. Moving to automotive.
Q1 revenue of $138 million, increased 10% sequentially and declined 10% from the year ago quarter. Our DRIVE O-RAN SoC is now in production and kicks off a major product cycle with auto customers ramping in Q2 and beyond. O-RAN has great traction in the marketplace with over 35 customer wins from automakers, truck makers, and robotaxi companies. In Q1, BYD, China's largest EV maker, and Lucid, an award winning EV pioneer, were the latest to announce that they are building their next-generation fleets on DRIVE O-RAN.
Customers remain supply constrained in their infrastructure needs and continue to add capacity as they try to keep pace with demand. Revenue from vertical industries grew a strong double-digit percentage from last year. Top verticals driving growth this quarter include; consumer Internet companies, financial services, and telecom. Overall, Data Center growth was driven primarily by strong adoption of our A100 GPU for both training and inference with large volume deployments by hyperscale customers and broadening adoption across the vertical industries.
Future NVIDIA chips, the CPUs, GPUs, DPUs, NICs and SoCs will integrate NVLink just like Grace Hopper based on our world-class SERDES technology. We're making NVLink open to customers and partners to implement custom chips that connect to NVIDIA's platforms. In networking, we're kicking off a major product cycle with the introduction of Spectrum-4, the world's first 400-gigabit per second end-to-end Ethernet networking platform, including the Spectrum-4 Switch, ConnectX-7 SmartNIC, Bluefield-3 DPU and the DOCA software. Built for AI and video Spectrum 4 arrives as data centers are growing exponentially and demanding extreme performance, advanced security and powerful features to enable high-performance advanced virtualization and simulation at scale.
Across our businesses, we are launching multiple new GPU, CPU, DPU and SOC quarters over the coming quarters, with a ramp in supply to support the customer demand. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 65.5% and non-GAAP gross margin was up 67.1%, up 90 basis points from a year ago and up 10 basis points sequentially. We have been able to offset rising costs and supply chain pressures.
We are closely managing our operating expenses to balance the current macro environment with our growth opportunities, and we've been very successful in hiring so far this year and are now slowing to integrate these new employees. This also enables us to focus our budget on taking care of our existing employees as inflation persist. We are still on track to grow our non-GAAP operating expenses in the high 20s range this year. we expect sequential increases to level off after Q2 as the first half of the year includes a significant amount of expenses related to the bring-up of multiple new products, which should not reoccur in the second half.
GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65.1% and 67.1%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $2.46 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $1.75 billion. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an expense of approximately $40 million, excluding gains and losses on non-affiliated investments.
GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 12.5% plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. And capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million to $450 million.

Thanks, Simona. This was a challenging quarter. Total revenue of $6.7 billion was down 19% sequentially and up 3% year on year, below the $8.1 billion outlook we provided on our last earnings call. As we had indicated in our pre-announcement press release on August 8, we experienced a shortfall to our expectations driven primarily by weaker Gaming revenue.
Today, we will share with you more details on our Q2 results and Q3 outlook. Starting with Gaming. Revenue of $2.04 billion was down 44% sequentially and down 33% year on year, reflecting challenging market conditions. As discussed in May, we expected a sequential decline in Gaming revenue due to softness in Europe related to the war in Ukraine and COVID lockdowns in China.
We are unable to accurately quantify the extent to which reduced crypto money contributed to the decline in Gaming demand. While Gaming navigates significant short-term macroeconomic challenges, we believe the long-term fundamentals in Gaming remain strong. NVIDIA RTX has redefined computer graphics and is now supported by almost 300 games and applications. NVIDIA's GeForce GPUs are the most coveted brand by gamers, representing 15 of the top 15 most popular GPUs on Steam.
Revenue of $3.81 billion grew 1% sequentially and 61% year on year. Although a record, this was somewhat short of our expectations as we were impacted by supply chain disruptions. Revenue from hyperscale customers nearly doubled year on year. Sequentially, sales to North America hyperscale and cloud computing customers increased but were more than offset by lower sales to China hyperscale customers affected by domestic economic conditions.
72% of the systems on the latest top 500 list of the world's fastest supercomputers are powered by NVIDIA, including 31 of 39 new systems. NVIDIA's own Selene supercomputer ranks at No. 8 in the top 500 and is the world's fastest enterprise supercomputer. Moreover, 22 of the top 30 systems on the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient supercomputers are powered by NVIDIA.
Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 43.5%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 45.9%. Gross margin includes $1.22 billion in charges for inventory and related reserves based on revised expectations of future demand and $122 million for warranty reserves. These charges incurred in the quarter reflect purchase commitments that we made during a time of severe component shortages and our current expectation of ongoing macro uncertainty.
We have nearly $12 billion remaining under our authorization through December of 2023. Let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal '23. We expect Gaming and ProViz revenue to decline sequentially as OEMs and channel partners reduce inventory levels to align with current levels of demand and prepare for our new product generation. We expect that decline to be partially offset by sequential growth in Data Center and Automotive.
Revenue is expected to be $5.9 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.4% and 65%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.59 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.82 billion.
GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an expense of approximately $10 million, excluding gains and losses on nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 9.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $550 million to $600 million.

Starting with data center. Revenue of $3.83 billion was up 1% sequentially and 31% year-on-year. This reflects very solid performance in the face of macroeconomic challenges new export controls and lingering supply chain disruptions. Year-on-year growth was driven primarily by leading U.S.
During the quarter, the U.S. government announced new restrictions impacting exports of our A100 and H-100 based products to China, and any product destined for certain systems or entities in China. These restrictions impacted third quarter revenue, largely offset by sales of alternative products into China.

I would like to honor the work done by our employees around the world. They have coped with extraordinary exigencies and provided a profound service to their customers and to their communities. That the company's purpose has endured and indeed thrived through such challenging times is a tribute to Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and the culture they created and have curated.
I would like to reiterate that our Board authorized a $1 billion stock repurchase program in September. As we previously indicated, we have refrained from executing on the buyback during this quiet period, but that period officially ends in coming days. It is a very different buyback to that which was approved in 2013 when we were unsure about share dislocation at the time of the separation from Fox.
We now have confidence in our performance, our resilience, our ability to generate cash for our investors, and our potential. Bolstering that confidence is the fact that our recent acquisitions are exceeding our expectations, and our core segments are thriving. We now have an optionality across the businesses and significantly more flexibility in our ability to return capital to our investors.
News Media was a strong contributor to News Corp profitability this quarter with segment EBITDA of $34 million in the quarter after a loss in the same period last year, thus is a tribute to Rebekah Brooks, Michael Miller, and Sean Giancola and their talented, committed teams. The transformation was, in part, due to the benefits of our deals with the major tech platforms, notably Google and Facebook.
The company built on its momentum from last fiscal in the first quarter, and we remain optimistic about growth prospects going forward. Clearly, there are macroeconomic pressures affecting certain companies, but our increasingly digital orientation has bolstered our ability to weather the pandemic and deal with the economic uncertainty in some of our markets. We are confident in our employees, confident in our businesses, and very confident in our prospects.
Total segment EBITDA was $410 million, up 53% versus the prior year, the highest quarterly growth rate since 2017 despite the challenges from the lockdowns in Australia and comparing against 21% total segment EBITDA growth in the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, currency fluctuations, and other items disclosed in the release, adjusted revenues, and adjusted total segment EBITDA rose 10% and 47%, respectively. Reported EPS was $0.33 as compared to $0.06 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.23 in the quarter compared to $0.08 in the prior year.
Encouragingly, new listings are up from their recent lows, and we have seen moderation of lead volume declines in September and October. Pricing remains robust given strong agent demand. REA had an exceptional quarter with revenues rising 62% year-over-year to $246 million, including a $7 million or 3% positive impact from currency fluctuations. Results benefited from $43 million of contribution from the Mortgage Choice acquisition and $8 million from the consolidation of Elara, which has been rebranded to REA India. The underlying performance was very encouraging with Australian residential revenue growth driven by an increase in debt penetration, price increase, and favorable product mix.
The revenue growth was also driven by an 11% increase in new buy listings despite lockdowns across multiple states, including restrictions on physical inspections in Melbourne. Melbourne listings rose 79%, while Sydney fell 7%. Financial services also benefited from higher settlements and submissions. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call, following this call for more details.
I would now like to talk about some themes for the upcoming quarter. Notwithstanding our strong results in the prior year, we remain encouraged by overall trends. Like many companies, we are closely monitoring supply chain issues, particularly in book publishing and our mastheads, as well as the impact of wage inflation on talent and retention.
Overall, we continue to expect costs for the full year to be relatively stable in local currency. At Dow Jones, overall trends across the business remains strong with advertising and subscriptions growth continuing to perform well.",12.0,Negligible
OKE,2022,1,"Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and investment in our company. On today's call is Walt Hulse, chief financial officer and executive vice president, investor relations and corporate development; and Kevin Burdick, executive vice president and chief commercial officer.
Currently, our process volumes are more than 1.1 billion cubic feet per day, and our NGL volumes are more than 320,000 barrels per day and trending up as shut-in wells are brought back online. The coordination during and since these weather events with our customers, local agencies, communities, and other operators in the area has been impressive, once again highlighting the resiliency of our employees, assets, and our customers. Even with this late winter storm, we are affirming our financial guidance ranges and midpoints for both adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share. With that, I'll turn the call over to Walt for a discussion of our financial performance.
Thank you, Pierce. ONEOK's first quarter 2022 net income totaled $391 million, or $0.87 per share, a 24% increase compared with the first quarter 2021 when excluding the benefit of Winter Storm Uri. First quarter EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA increased 11% year over year when excluding Winter Storm Uri. We ended the first quarter with a higher inventory of unfractionated NGLs primarily due to timing and expect to recognize those earnings in the second quarter as our current inventory is fractionated and sold.
Our net debt-to-EBITDA on an annualized run-rate basis remains below four times, and we continue to view three and a half times or lower as our long-term aspirational leverage goal. In April, Moody's updated ONEOK's rating outlook to positive, and affirmed our investment-grade rating. ONEOK maintains investment-grade ratings with Moody's, S&P and Fitch. As Pierce mentioned, the recent extreme April storms have impacted our operations in the Rocky Mountain region.
Thank you, Walt. During the first quarter, we saw a double-digit NGL volume growth across all our operating regions compared with the first quarter 2021, and Rocky Mountain region natural gas processing volumes increased 11% year over year. After reporting record Rocky Mountain region natural gas and NGL volumes in the fourth quarter 2021, we saw volumes decrease sequentially in the first quarter 2022, primarily due to normal seasonality across our operating areas. Through the first four months of the year, we've continued to see encouraging activity from producers, and we expect these activity levels to trend higher through the remainder of the year.
While first-quarter ethane recovery is typically lighter due to natural gas heating demand and typical winter weather impacts, we see strong ethane recovery opportunities for the remainder of the year. Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. In the Rocky Mountain region, first quarter processed volumes averaged 1.3 billion cubic feet per day, an 11% increase year over year. In April, volumes reached a peak of more than 1.4 billion cubic feet per day prior to the storms.
We connected more than 90 wells in the region in the first quarter compared with 38 connections in the first quarter 2021, and are on pace to meet our guidance midpoint of 400 well connections in the region. There are currently 38 rigs and 12 completion crews operating in the basin, with 17 rigs and approximately half of the completion crews on our dedicated acreage. This continues to be more than enough activity to grow gas production in the basin and on our acreage. Additionally, the basinwide DUC inventory remains at approximately 500, with half of those on our dedicated acreage.
We continue to expect increased natural gas processing volumes from the region compared with 2021 and expect the majority of rigs basin wide to drive additional NGLs to our system. In the natural gas pipeline segment, strong first-quarter results benefited from increased natural gas sales and higher seasonal volumes compared with the fourth quarter 2021. We continue to see strong demand for natural gas storage services and are working to expand our facilities to meet this increasing demand. We recently completed a 1.1 billion cubic feet expansion of our Texas storage facilities and announced an open season to increase our storage capabilities in Oklahoma, enabling an additional 4 billion cubic feet of storage capacity to be contracted.",26.0,
OKE,2022,2,"Good day, and welcome to the second quarter 2022 ONEOK Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Andrew Ziola, vice president, investor relations.
Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and investment in our company. On today's call is Walt Hulse, chief financial officer and executive vice president, investor relations and corporate development; and Kevin Burdick, executive vice president and chief commercial officer.
Two separate April weather events caused widespread outages and power, disrupting midstream and producer operations across the region. Our employees were well-prepared and quickly responded to the challenge. They remain focused on the safe operation of our assets and the safety of the communities where we operate. And they work with local agencies, customers, utility providers to resume normal operations as quickly as possible.
Across our operations, we continue to see strength in producer activity, with commodity prices and demand supporting a strong second half of the year. While it is still too early to provide our outlook for 2023, we are well-positioned across our integrated footprint to help transport and process central natural gas and natural gas liquids. Before I turn the call over, I'd like to make and provide an update on the Medford, Oklahoma fractionation facility. On Saturday, July 9, mid-afternoon, there was a fire at the facility.
First and foremost, all of our personnel were safe and accounted for. The safety of our employees and communities is always the main concern and initial focus during a situation like this. I would like to thank the many employees, first responders and local agencies who worked together to quickly respond to the incident. We cannot say enough about the corporation and the coordination efforts of those teams who work to put a safety of our personnel and the surrounding community first.
As of June 30, our net debt-to-EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 3.8 times, and we continue to view 3.5 times or lower as our long-term aspirational leverage goal. In June, we redeemed nearly $900 million of senior notes due in October 22, with cash and short-term borrowings. We currently have no long-term debt maturities due until September of 2023. Yesterday, we reaffirmed our 2022 financial guidance expectations.
And to expand on Pierce's comments earlier, as we sit today, we still expect to achieve the midpoint of our guidance ranges, which remain at $1.69 billion for net income and $3.62 billion for adjusted EBITDA. We expect total 2022 capital expenditures to trend toward the upper end of the range of our guidance range of $900 million to $1.05 billion driven by higher producer activity levels and expansion opportunities in our natural gas pipeline business. Positive drilling activity across our operations and expectations for higher natural gas and NGL volumes in the second half of 2022 support our financial guidance and continue to point to a strong volume exit rate this year. I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for a commercial update.
Thank you, Walt.During the second quarter, we saw NGL volume growth across all our operating regions compared with the first quarter 2022. NGL volume expectations remain strong through the remainder of the year, providing confidence in achieving the midpoint of our raw feed throughput guidance for 2022. Natural gas processed volumes and well completions during the quarter were significantly impacted by the April weather events and we now expect process volumes to be toward the lower end of our 2022 volume guidance range. Let's take a closer look at our natural gas liquids segment.
In the Permian Basin, NGL volumes increased 10% year over year and 4% compared with the first quarter of 2022. We recently completed a 25,000 barrel per day expansion on a portion of our West Texas NGL pipeline in the basin to support continued expected volume growth. We saw increased ethane volumes on our system in the second quarter of 2022 and expect continued opportunities for ethane to be recovered through the remainder of the year. We anticipate high levels of recovery in the Permian Basin, periodic recovery in the Mid-Continent and continued opportunities to incentivize ethane recovery in the Rocky Mountain region as in-basin natural gas prices fluctuate.
Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. In the Rocky Mountain region, second quarter processed volumes averaged more than 1.2 billion cubic feet per day, a slight decrease compared with the first quarter 2022 due to the April weather. We've seen recent volumes return to pre-storm levels, and in July, volumes reached approximately 1.4 billion cubic feet per day. Through the first 6 months of the year, we've connected 157 wells in the region and we continue to expect approximately 375 to 425 well connections in the region this year.
There are currently approximately 45 rigs and 18 completion crews operating in the basin, with 21 rigs and approximately half the completion crews on our dedicated acreage. Basinwide, rigs have more than doubled in the last 12 months from only 20 rigs total in July 2021. As we've said before, approximately 15 rigs on our acreage can maintain natural gas production at current levels. But with more than 20 currently on our acreage, we expect to see higher well connections in 2023 compared with 2022 if these activity levels remain.
The basinwide DUC inventory remains at approximately 500, with half of those on our dedicated acreage. This compares with approximately 650 DUCs in a basin a year ago. Recent producer M&A in the Williston Basin continues to show the value and long-term viability of the play. We see these recent announcements as positive for ONEOK as we expect increased activity from the acquirers to drive NGL and natural gas volumes to our system.
In the mid-continent region, we continue to see increased activity with four rigs now operating on our acreage and 46 rigs basinwide. We expect steady to increasing activity through the remainder of the year with the majority of rigs basinwide driving additional NGLs to our system. In the Natural Gas Pipelines segment, strong second quarter results benefited from the continued increasing demand for natural gas storage and transportation services. Last quarter, we discussed a recently completed 1.1 billion cubic feet expansion of our Texas storage facility, which is now fully subscribed through 2032.
Thank you, Walt and Kevin. As we enter the second half of 2022, we see producer activity and attractive commodity prices providing tailwinds to our business. We've affirmed our financial guidance for the year underscoring the resiliency of our operations, earnings and employees who are always ready and willing to respond to changing market and operational dynamics. Challenges happen in our business and weather is unpredictable.
The report details our most recent environmental, social and governance-related performance and programs and highlights key initiatives underway across the company. Our ESG efforts are a source of pride for ONEOK, and we are committed to continuing to make progress in these important areas. With that, operator, we're now ready for questions.",26.0,
OKE,2022,3,"Good day, and welcome to the ONEOK's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call and webcast. [Operator instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Ziola, vice president of investor relations. Please go ahead.
Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call this morning. We appreciate your interest and investment in our company. On the call today is Walt Hulse, the chief financial officer and executive vice president, investor relations, and corporate development; and Kevin Burdick, executive vice president and chief commercial officer.
Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, our senior vice president of natural gas liquids and natural gas gathering and processing; and Chuck Kelley, our senior vice president of natural gas pipelines. Yesterday, we announced strong third quarter 2022 earnings, affirmed our 2022 financial guidance midpoints, and provided our 2023 growth outlook to exceed $4 billion of adjusted EBITDA. Our third quarter results demonstrate the resiliency of our strategic and integrated assets in some of the most highly productive U.S. shale basins, and our employees who are dedicated -- have dedicated themselves to the safety and reliability, and sustainability of our operations.
We will provide additional updates as we move forward in this process when material information is available. And lastly, for the third quarter, we ended with higher NGL inventory levels that have since been sold forward, and we will realize $17 million earnings benefit from those sales in the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2023. As of September 30, our net debt-to-EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 3.8 times, and we continue to view 3.5 times or lower as our long-term aspirational goal. We currently have no long-term debt maturities until September of 2023 and we have no material exposure to floating interest rates through our current outstanding long-term debt.
Thank you, Walt. Let's start with our natural gas liquids segment. Rocky Mountain region NGL volumes increased 17% year over year and 12% compared with the second quarter 2022, driven by volume recovery following the April severe weather and overall volume growth, including higher incentivized ethane on our system. Volumes have remained strong in the region with September averaging more than 380,000 barrels per day.
We expect ethane demand to remain muted somewhat in the fourth quarter and into early 2023. And this has been factored into our 2022 and 2023 expectations. As we sit today, we are seeing ethane and ethylene inventories starting to get worked off, which we believe will lead to increasing demand in 2023. As for ONEOK, it is typical that we don't incentivize as much ethane out of the Bakken during the winter season due to higher natural gas prices and natural gas demand, but we will continue to be opportunistic.
As it relates to our 2023 outlook, we expect the Permian to be in full ethane recovery, the Mid-Continent to be in partial recovery, and the Rockies continuing to provide opportunities to incentivize recovery. Construction continues on our 125,000 barrel per day MB-5 fractionator in Mont Belvieu, which we still expect to be completed early in the second quarter of 2023 and is reflected in our updated 2022 capital guidance. Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. Producer activity remained strong in the Rocky Mountain region with third quarter processed volumes averaging 1.4 billion cubic feet per day, a record quarter for us.
Activity still remains high, just some timing elements that we now expect will push a few large pad completions into next year. These same factors also led us adjusting our volume expectations for 2022 to be near or slightly below the guidance range. There are currently more than 40 rigs and 18 completion crews operating in the basin, with more than 20 rigs and approximately half the completion crews on our dedicated acreage. As we've said before, approximately 15 rigs on our acreage to maintain natural gas production at current levels.
This project is expected to be complete in April 2023 and is nearly 90% subscribed through 2029, and we are also evaluating an additional expansion of our Texas storage assets. And lastly, before I turn the call back to Pierce, we began a compression electrification project on our interstate Viking gas transmission pipeline to improve operational reliability and provide future greenhouse gas emissions reductions on the system. The project is expected to cost $95 million and be completed in the third quarter of 2023 and is included in our outlook. Pierce, that concludes my remarks.
Thank you, Walt and Kevin. As we enter the last couple of months of 2022 and look forward to the next year, I'm proud of our employees and want to thank them for their hard work and contributions who continue to focus on operating safely, sustainably and environmentally responsible and are key to our success as a midstream operator. How we operate is important, but also how we engage with our employees, communities and other stakeholders is equally as important. Also important for ONEOK is to remain focused on meeting the growing energy demand for today even as it looks forward to helping drive the energy transformation needs for the future.
We also recently announced that ONEOK joined with two other large publicly traded companies based in Oklahoma and a venture capital firm to fund an effort to transform Oklahoma into a hub of energy technology start-ups and redefine a sector that has shaped the region's economy for more than a century. We believe this partnership aligns to our long-term business strategy, which includes potential low-carbon investments that contribute to low -- long-term growth and business diversification. ONEOK has been building the right teams and resources to better participate in the innovative practices and technologies that it sees now and those that may play a role in the future. Before I turn the call over for Q&A, I wanted to highlight an important ESG item we mentioned in our earnings release.",26.0,
PH,2022,2,"I'd like to direct you to Slide No. 2, which details our disclosure statement addressing forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures are included in today's materials. Those materials, those reconciliations, along with this presentation, are accessible under the Investors section at parker.com and will be available for one year.
This is against arguably one of the most difficult operating environments that we've all faced in our careers when you add up the cumulative effect of inflation, supply chain challenges and the Omicron virus. My thanks to the global team for just a great job execution in this quarter and really the execution for many, many quarters as we go through this presentation. Let's start with the first bullet. Focus on safety continues.
Robust demand environment continues. We had over 90% of our end markets in the growth phase, which we're very excited about. And this execution, what you're seeing, is really the cumulative effect of win strategy 2.0 and 3.0 driving this kind of performance. When you add the strategy changes on top of the portfolio, things we've done, adding those great acquisitions that we've done over the last number of years and the powerful secular trends that I'm going to talk about here momentarily, we see the future has much longer cycle and more resilient and faster growing.
If you look on the right-hand side and we don't guide on EBITDA margin, but we put in our EBITDA margin year to date to 22.4%. If you look at that from FY '16 to that, it's 770 basis points improvement, just remarkable improvement. Really the how behind these results, it's been our people, portfolio changes that we've done and has been, again, a cumulative effect of win strategy 2.0, 3.0. So if you go to the next slide, give you a quick update on the Meggitt transaction.
I would characterize those as constructive and positive and on track. And then the antitrust and FDI filings are proceeding as we had anticipated. We're still anticipating a Q3 calendar 2022 close and we're really excited about this. This is obviously a compelling combination.
Now I touched on aerospace and the recovery and momentum of Meggitt plus Parker. But if you look at electrification, ESG, digitization, what you have here are long-term multiyear growth enablers and content growth for us is going to grow, both onboard as well as infrastructure. And we're excited that this is going to be a big part of what we'll talk about at investor day and we look forward to sharing more about these secular trends on March 8 with you. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Todd for more details on the quarter.
And as you can see really, operating execution is the major driver in this increase. Adjusted segment operating income did increase by $132 million. That's 19% greater than prior year. And that really accounts for 80% of the increase in our EPS this quarter.
And we do have reduced pension expense versus prior year. All of that added up to $0.19. And then you could see the other items on the slide that all netted to $0.04 favorable. But really, the story here is just a very strong operating quarter.
Just a little color on Diversified Industrial North America, sales reached $1.8 billion. Organic growth in that segment was 15% versus prior year. And listen, we're really pleased with the performance in this region. We've talked a lot -- I've read -- I know everyone is familiar with the well documented supply chain issues.
Tom mentioned the Omicron spike. We are not immune to that. But we did keep operating margins at a very high level of 21.3% in this segment and we're proud of that. Order rates continued to be very high at plus 17.
We are benefiting from some product mix. And really, the team is doing a great job controlling cost. And this has been a really long-term effort over a long period of time from that team. So I'm really happy that they're able to put up these continued high level of margin performance.
We've got positive growth, strong order dollars, robust backlogs, record margins and really just solid execution across the board. So great segment performance. If I take you to Slide 12 and talk about cash flow on a year-to-date basis, we did exceed $1 billion in cash flow from operations. That is 13.3% of sales.
The working capital change did improve in the quarter as we forecasted. In the quarter, it was a 1.9% use of cash. Versus last year, it was a 4.1% source of cash. So for the full year, I just want to reiterate, we continue to forecast mid-teens cash flow from operations and free cash flow for the full year will exceed 100%.
I did mention on the last call that we secured a deal contingent forward hedge contract in the amount of GBP 6.4 billion. Accounting rules require us to mark those contracts to market. That impact in the quarter was a non-cash charge of $149 million. We booked that in the other expense line and we are treating that as an adjusted item.
And the breakdown of that sales change at the midpoint is organic growth is 10 and a half percent. Currency will be about one point unfavorable. And of course, there's no impact from acquisitions. As Tom said, we don't expect Meggitt to close in our fiscal year.
If we look at the full year adjusted segment operating margin, we're also raising that 20 basis points from the prior guide. Full year now, we expect that to be 22.1% at the midpoint. There is a 20 basis point range on either side of that. And corporate G&A and other is expected to be $656 million on an as reported basis, but $435 million on an adjusted basis.
So of course, there's a couple of adjusted items in there. The acquisition-related intangible assets, that is a standard adjustment, the realignment expenses standard adjustment, the lowered cost to achieve standard adjustment. But we are adjusting these transaction-related expenses for Meggitt. Year to date, we've got $71 million worth of transaction costs and of course, that $149 million non-cash mark-to-market loss that I just mentioned.
We're going to continue to adjust for the transaction-related expenses as they are incurred. If you look at tax rate, tax rate is now going to be slightly lower than what we had forecasted just based on first half activity. We expect that to be 22% now. And finally, guidance for the full year assumed sales, adjusted operating income and EPS all split, 48% first half, 52% in the second half.
Thank you, Todd. We've got a highly engaged team around the world living up to our purpose, which is enabling engineering breakthroughs that lead to a better tomorrow. You've seen what 3.0 has done, as I referenced in that EPS chart, describing our current performance that's going to drive our future performance. It's the early days of win strategy 3.0 and I would characterize it as having long legs, lots of potential ahead with win strategy 3.0.
The portfolio transformation continues. We've acquired three great companies, are in the process of a fourth that will make us longer cycle and more resilient. And if you put that on top of the secular trends that I highlighted, we feel very, very positive about the future. So it's been our portfolio changes.",29.0,Medium
PH,2022,3,"I know we all lived through it, but just as a refresher of what happened in Q3, we had the omicron spikes, which drove absenteeism; we had supply chain challenges; inflation; China COVID shutdowns; and the Ukraine war. So just your basic average quarter. Obviously, I'm being sarcastic, but obviously, not ideal conditions. And what was remarkable against that backdrop, we turned in a number of all-time records, as I mentioned.
And my thanks to the entire team for this great performance and resilience in these times. So a couple of comments about the quarter on Slide 3. Safety is our top priority. We continue to be top quartile when you look at our performance on safety incidents versus our peers.
Segment operating margin was 20.3% as reported or 22.7% adjusted. That was 130 basis points better than prior year. So expanded margins, 130 basis points in the kind of conditions that I started the call with, just remarkable performance. We increased the quarterly dividend 29%.
That is the largest increase in our history and clearly signals the confidence that we have about Parker for the future. We have some temporary things, which we highlighted in the future slides here, that Todd will go over about the Q4 impact related to China COVID shutdowns. The comment here I just want to make is that that's a temporary thing. How long it goes, it's hard to predict, but we expect to come up to full production sometime in Q1, and that will make up this delta that we're experiencing to Q4 during the course of the rest of FY '23.
And I want to give you one example on Slide 5, probably our purpose in action related to clean technologies. As the world migrates to a more carbon-friendly environment and applications, we're going to be there to help. One very topical and current area given the inflation pressures in the Russia-Ukraine war is the topic of energy and the availability of energy and inflation of energy prices around the world. And as the world moves from brown sources of energy to greener sources of energy, it's pretty clear that we're going to need to use all shades of color between brown to green as we walk to that cleaner tomorrow.
And clearly, a big part of that bridge to that cleaner tomorrow is going to be natural gas. And we wanted to talk about really natural gas, where we play in it, and just how we're going to be able to help society, our purpose, and action here. So upstream -- there's four main components here: upstream, midstream, liquefaction, storage and regasification and power generation. On the bottom of this slide, you see the six Parker technologies that we utilize to go into there and a couple of anecdotal comments for each one.
On the liquefaction, storage, and regasification, that will be our pumps, our valves, ceiling technologies, glucan vance. And this is all under cryogenic conditions, so ultra-low temperatures. And then power gen, I'm going to cover on the next slide. So a lot of what we do for society on compressed natural gas and liquid natural gas is going to be directly applicable as the world moves to hydrogen, which is on Slide 6.
So that last value chain as part of natural gas that incurred was the power generation piece. And clearly, what's obvious here and what's really helpful for us, and I think our customers, is all the technologies that we have on CNG and LNG are directly applicable into hydrogen. You can see in the middle of the page, the applications, those five bullets we have in the middle. On the right-hand side are our various technologies and similar technologies for both fuel sources.
It's been our people, which is really their engagement, their ownership, those top-quartile results that we see from our people driving top-quartile performance. So in the portfolio, and I would just summarize it, we're going to -- when we close Meggitt, we will deploy $20 billion of money into acquisitions, reshaping the portfolio. We will have doubled engineered materials, doubled aerospace and doubled our filtration businesses over this period of time, dramatically reshaping the company and the future of the company. And then on the strategy side, you have the Win Strategy 2.0 and 3.0 now over this period of time.
We've received conditional antitrust clearance from the European Commission, subject to our commitment to divest of our aircraft mill and brake business, which is in process. And then on the foreign investment side of things, the transaction has been cleared by Australia, Denmark, Germany, and Italy. So probably the simplest way for me to describe it, what remains and what's left are antitrust clearances for the U.S. and the U.K.
We finished at 22.7% on an adjusted basis. And I'll go through the segments in a couple of slides, but really, every segment, every region contributed to this performance. The inflationary and supply chain issues, they are persistent. They remain.
Yet our team members are really showing their resiliency as we leverage the win strategy to really achieve our goal, which is top-quartile performance. When you look at EBITDA, our EBITDA margins expanded 70 basis points. We finished at 22.6 for the quarter. And net income -- adjusted net income grew by 16% in the quarter, and we finished at $630 million or 15.4% return on sales.
Net income grew 16% versus prior year. Very, very impressive. I think we've mentioned this multiple times before, but Tom was talking about Meggitt. The currency deal contingent hedge we have, pound to dollar, requires mark-to-market accounting treatment.
Due to what's going on with currency rates and really the strengthening of the dollar versus the pound, we did record a pre-tax noncash charge in the quarter of $247 million, and that really accounts for the major difference between the as-reported and the adjusted numbers this quarter. When you look at EPS, we did $4.83. That is $0.71 greater than prior year. That's up 17% from the $4.12 we did last year.
Demand is -- continues to be robust. Our orders are up 14%. The team has taken prudent actions to manage the inflationary environment. And that really has positioned us to continue to maintain margin-neutral on all of these price cost issues that are fairly well documented across the world.
That and the operating execution that I talked about really allowed us to improve margins in every segment. If you look at our incrementals, 37%, we've talked about this a couple of times, but we still are going up against pandemic-level comps. We had $25 million of discretionary savings in Q3. If you account for that, incrementals would have been 44% for the quarter.
North America has certainly had challenges across the supply chain. It's great to see them rebound and lead the company again. Their incrementals improved in the quarter, and they're the best incrementals they generated all fiscal year. And even more importantly, order rates accelerated to 23% and backlog, of course, grew even stronger.
And obviously, greater than 100% conversion when it comes to cash flow conversion. Tom called out the 29% dividend increase that we announced. This really reflects the confidence we have and our ability to generate cash, not just in the short term but in the long term as we look out to achieving those FY '27 goals. Just a few notes on leverage.
Sales growth for the full year is forecasted to be about 10%. We did increase the organic guide 50 basis points from 10.5% to 11%, so 11% full year organic growth. And while currency remains a headwind in the quarter, for the full year, we think it will be about a 1% drag to the top line. Just a reminder on currency, for our guide, we are using March 31st rates to calculate our estimate.
And finally, that deal contingent hedge that I mentioned, on a full year basis, it's $396 million. We will continue to adjust transaction-related expenses as they are incurred, all the way up until we get to close. And a note on tax. Our full year tax rate is down a little bit.
We expect that to be about 21.5% for the full year. And when you do all the math, for us, that equates to an EPS -- adjusted EPS guide for Q4 of $4.60. This quarter, we actually put another slide in here. It's a bridge on our guidance reconciliation.
And that really is generating about $0.08 of segment operating income in Q4. Tom has mentioned this, but the COVID-related shutdowns in China are a near-term temporary headwind for us in Q4. Obviously, Q4 is the end of our fiscal year here. We are estimating that to impact Q4 sales by $100 million.
We're using a 40% decremental on this $100 million, which is greater than what we normally operate at, simply because a number of our facilities are fully shut down. So we are confident that the facilities that are operating in China and those others in the international segment are going to be able to perform, but we're using a 40% decremental on just that $100 million of near-term headwind. That equates to a $0.24 EPS headwind going into Q4. All the other items net to a slight EPS reduction of $0.03, and that really is the walk on how we get to our new guide of $18.15.
Their ownership, their engagement that drove the -- is driving our success. You saw the EPS and the margin expansion, just phenomenal, speaks to the Win Strategy, speaks to the portfolio changes. We are a longer-cycle, more resilient company. And we've got great alignment to the secular trends that I referred to earlier.
And we're going to help the world as it moves to the clean technologies to be more sustainable. We gave you a new guide -- new feedback where we're headed for FY '27 with continued improvement across the board and really a transformed company with a bright promising future. Again, my thanks to everybody, the global team, just a fantastic quarter, fantastic year to date. And I'm going to turn it back to Paul to start the Q&A.",29.0,Medium
PNC,2022,1,"Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you've seen, we had a solid start to the year as we grew loans and securities, controlled expenses and our credit quality reserves and capital levels remain very strong. As we previously disclosed, noninterest income was below our expectations for the quarter. And while we had expected fees to be down sequentially, reflecting typical first quarter seasonality, the decline actually exceeded normal interest rate volatility, and probably, the Russian-Ukraine conflict adversely impacted certain of our capital markets businesses among other areas.
As we look forward, we're clearly in an environment of uncertainty here. We're also in an environment with rising interest rates, which benefit banks with increased loan demand, which benefit banks. And in PNC's case, a business or a bank that never changed its credit box on credit terms got really easy business that has a very -- or a bank that has a very solid mix of fee-based businesses, and importantly our bank that has substantially expanded its geographic presence. And I want to hit on that in a second just as it relates to our progress on BBVA.
In our Asset Management Group, we're making great progress and strategic investments to hire key people in business development and advisor roles, and importantly, our client opportunity pipelines are really strong. From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to deploy our excess liquidity as you've seen with solid loan growth and securities purchases. Spot loans grew $6 billion in the quarter, driven by the commercial side, which saw a nice increase in utilization. In fact, if we exclude the impact of PPP loan forgiveness, spot commercial loans grew $7 billion.
The fastest organic quarterly growth we've seen since the commercial defensive draws that we saw at the start of the pandemic. And by the way, we've seen that growth carry into the early part of April. We also remain active on the security side with net purchases of almost $6 billion during the quarter. From a balance sheet perspective, the securities were offset by unrealized losses due to rising interest rates, which Rob is going to discuss in a few minutes.
This doesn't impact our regulatory capital or earnings, but during the quarter, we moved approximately $20 billion of our securities available for sale to help the maturity to limit future valuation changes due to interest rate movements. Importantly, we saw a solid rebound in the yield on our securities. Overall, we believe we are well-positioned for the rising interest rate environment to deliver net interest income growth and NIM expansion throughout the year. And finally, during the quarter, we returned about $1.7 billion of capital to shareholders through share repurchases, dividends.
Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis. During the quarter, loans increased by $2 billion or 1%. Investment securities grew $6 billion or 5%, and Federal Reserve cash balances declined $13 billion or 17%, reflecting higher securities and loan balances as well as lower borrowed funds.
Deposit balances averaged $453 billion and were relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. Our tangible book value was $79.68 per common share as of March 31st, a 15% decline linked quarter, which was entirely driven by mark-to-market adjustments in our securities and swap portfolios as a result of higher interest rates. As a category three institution, we opted out of recognizing AOCI and regulatory capital, and as of March 31st, 2022, our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 9.9%. Given our strong capital ratios, we continue to be well-positioned with significant capital flexibility.
And as Bill just mentioned, our board recently approved a $0.25 increase to our quarterly cash dividend on common stock, raising the dividend to $1.50 per share. Additionally, during the first quarter, we completed share repurchases of $1.2 billion or 6.4 million shares. Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Average loans increased $2 billion linked quarter, and on a spot basis, loans grew $6 billion, or 2%.
PPP loan balances continued to decline and impacted first quarter growth by approximately $2 billion on both an average and spot basis. Looking at loan growth, excluding the impact of PPP loans, average loans increased $4 billion or 1%, driven by $5 billion of growth in commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by a $1 billion decline in commercial real estate balances and average consumer loans were stable linked quarter. On a spot basis, loans grew $8 billion. Commercial loans grew $7 billion, driven by higher utilization as well as new production within corporate banking and business credit businesses.
Notably, in our C&IB segment, the utilization rate increased 85 basis points and our overall commitments were 2% higher compared to year-end 2021. And consumer loans increased $900 million as higher mortgage balances were partially offset by lower auto and credit card loans. Moving to Slide 5. Average deposits of $453 billion remained stable compared to the fourth quarter.
On the right, you can see total deposits at period end were $450 billion, a decline of $7 billion or 2% linked quarter. All of the decline was on the commercial side where deposits were $10 billion lower, primarily driven by seasonal cash deployments. Partially offsetting the commercial decline, consumer deposits increased $3 billion, reflecting seasonally higher balances related to tax refund payments. Overall, our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits remained stable at four basis points, and importantly, we remain core funded with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 65% at the end of the first quarter.
Slide 6 details the change in our average securities and Federal Reserve balances. We've maintained high levels of liquidity over the past year while opportunistically purchasing securities. This trend continued into the first quarter as we added primarily U.S. treasuries and agency RMBS.
As a result, average security balances increased by 5% or $6 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, and now represent 27% of interest-earning assets. Slide 7 highlights the composition of our high-quality securities portfolio as well as the balance changes from year-end March 31st. During the first quarter, we added to our portfolio with net purchases of approximately $6 billion. However, the increase in rates during the first quarter resulted in higher net unrealized losses of approximately $6 billion, and accordingly, our period-end balances remained relatively state.
To moderate the impact of rising rates on security values and correspondingly AOCI, we transferred approximately $20 billion of securities from our available-for-sale portfolio and to help maturity at quarter-end. Importantly, fluctuations in AOCI did not have an impact on our earnings. However, we are mindful of the AOCI impact on tangible book value, and we'll continue to evaluate potential opportunities to further transfers. Turning to the income statement on Slide 8.
As you can see, first quarter 2022 reported EPS was $3.23, which included pre-tax integration costs of $31 million. Excluding integration costs, adjusted EPS was $3.29. During the first quarter, integration costs reduced revenue by $16 million and increased expenses by $15 million. First quarter revenue was down $435 million or 8% compared with the fourth quarter.
Expenses declined $619 million or 16% linked quarter, and excluding the impact of integration expenses, noninterest expense declined 7%. The first quarter provision recapture was $208 million, primarily reflecting the impact of improved COVID-19-related economic conditions, and our effective tax rate was 17%. So in total, net income was $1.4 billion in the first quarter. Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail.
Slide 9 details our revenue trends. Total revenue for the first quarter of $4.7 billion defined $430 million linked quarter. Net interest income of $2.8 billion was down $58 million, or 2%. Higher securities and loan balances, as well as increased security yields, were more than offset by a $74 million decline in PPP revenue due to loan forgiveness activity and the impact of two fewer days in the quarter.
And net interest margin of 2.28% was up one basis point. As we recently announced and effective for the first quarter, we recategorized the presentation of our noninterest income and provided an update to the related guidance. Consistent with those revisions, first quarter fee income was $1.7 billion, a decline of $296 million or 15% linked quarter. Looking at the detail of each revenue category.
Residential and commercial mortgage noninterest income was $50 million lower, primarily due to decreased commercial mortgage activities. And finally, other noninterest income declined $81 million, primarily due to lower private equity-related revenue and once again compared to elevated fourth quarter levels. Turning to Slide 10. Our first quarter expenses were down by $619 million or 16% linked quarter.
And as we previously stated, we have a goal to reduce costs by $300 million in 2022 through our continuous improvement program, and we're confident we'll achieve our full year target. As you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 11. Nonperforming loans of $2.3 billion decreased $182 million or 7% compared to December 31st, and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans.
Total delinquencies were $1.7 billion on March 31st, a $286 million decline from year-end, reflecting lower consumer and commercial loan delinquencies. The majority of these decreases resulted from our progress in resolving BBVA USA conversion-related administrative and operational delays. Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $137 million, an increase of $13 million linked quarter. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans continues to be historically low at 19 basis points.
And during the first quarter, we reduced our allowance for credit losses by approximately $300 million, and our reserves now total $5.2 billion or 1.8% of total loans. In summary, PNC reported a solid first quarter, and we're well-positioned for the remainder of 2022 as we continue to realize the potential of our coast-to-coast franchise. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we expect strong growth over the course of 2022, resulting in 3.7% average GDP growth. We also expect the Fed to raise rates by an additional cumulative 175 basis points through the remainder of this year to a range of 2% to 2.25% by year-end, and all of this is consistent with the update in our recent 8-K filing.
Considering our reported first quarter operating results, second quarter expectations, and current economic forecasts for the full year 2022 compared to the full year 2021, we expect average loan growth of approximately 10% and spot loan growth of 5%. We expect total revenue growth to be 9% to 11%. We expect expenses, excluding integration expense, to be at 4% to 6%. And we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.",22.0,Medium
PNC,2022,2,"Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you've seen, we had a strong second quarter, highlighted by 9% revenue growth and solid positive operating leverage resulting in PPNR growth of 23%. We maintained strong credit quality. And fees rebounded from the first quarter, driven primarily by capital markets activity, including Harris Williams, and continued growth in card and cash management.
The strong loan growth and rising rates helped us to increase both net interest income and net interest margin meaningfully. Loan growth was driven by C&I, where new production increased significantly. And utilization returned to near pre-pandemic levels. Consumer loans also grew, driven by mortgage and home equity.
Higher rates continued to adversely impact the unrealized value of our securities book. In response, we've continued to reposition the portfolio during the quarter, resulting in 60% of our securities portfolio now being held and held to maturity. We returned $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders during the quarter through share repurchases and dividends. Looking forward, there is uncertainty in the environment we're operating in, including the impact of higher rates, supply chain disruptions, and inflation.
But regardless of the path ahead macroeconomically, we believe having a strong balance sheet, a solid mix of fee-based businesses, continued focus on expense management, and differentiated strategies for organic growth will continue to provide the foundation for our success. And our focus is on executing the things we can control and not getting distracted by what is beyond our control. Along those lines, we delivered well on our strategic priorities in the quarter, including the build-out of our new BBVA and expansion markets, modernizing our retail banking technology platform, bolstering our asset management offering, and building differentiated and responsible capabilities for our retail and commercial customers in the payment space. As I've talked about recently at conferences, our performance in the BBVA markets has exceeded our own expectations.
And our average cash balances at the Federal Reserve declined $23 billion. Deposit balances averaged $447 billion, a decline of $7 billion or 2%. Our tangible book value was $74.39 per common share as of June 30th, a 7% decline linked quarter, entirely AOCI driven as a function of higher rates. And as of June 30, 2022, our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 9.6%.
Given our strong capital ratios, we continue to be well-positioned with significant capital flexibility. During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders through $627 million of common dividends and $737 million of share repurchases for 4.3 million shares. Our recent CCAR results underscore the strength of our balance sheet and support our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. As you know, our stress capital buffer for the fourth quarter period beginning in October 2022, is now 2.9%, and our applicable ratios are comfortably in excess of the regulatory minimums.
Earlier this year, our board of directors authorized a new repurchase framework, which allows for up to 100 million common shares, of which approximately 59% were still available for repurchase as of June 30th. This allows for the continuation of our recent average share repurchase levels in dollars, as well as the flexibility to increase those levels should conditions warrant. Slide 5 shows our loans in more detail. During the second quarter, we delivered solid loan growth across our expanded franchise, particularly when compared to 2021 growth rates.
2021, as you know, was characterized by low utilization levels, PPP loan forgiveness, and, in PNC's case, a repositioning of certain acquisition-related portfolios. Loan balances averaged $305 billion, an increase of $14 billion or 5% compared to the first quarter, reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans. Commercial loans, excluding PPP, grew $13 billion, driven by higher new production as well as utilization. Included in this growth was approximately $5 billion related to high-quality short-term loans that are expected to mature during the second half of the year.
Notably, in our C&IB segment, the utilization rate increased more than 120 basis points, and our overall commitments were 5% higher compared to the first quarter. PPP loan balances declined $1.2 billion, and at the end of the quarter were less than $1 billion. Consumer loans increased $2 billion as higher mortgage and home equity balances were partially offset by lower auto loans. And loan yields increased 10 basis points compared to the first quarter, driven by higher interest rates.
Slide 6 highlights the composition of our deposit portfolio as well as the average balance changes linked quarter. We have a strong core deposit base, which is two-thirds interest-bearing and one-third noninterest-bearing. Within interest-bearing, 70% are consumer, and within noninterest-bearing, 50% are commercial compensating balances and represent stable operating deposits. At the end of the second quarter, our loan-to-deposit ratio was 71%, which remains well below our pre-pandemic historic average.
On the right, you can see linked quarter change in deposits in more detail. Deposits averaged $447 billion in the second quarter, a decline of nearly $7 billion or 2% linked quarter. Commercial deposits declined $8 billion or 4%, primarily in noninterest-bearing deposits due to movement to higher yielding investments and seasonality. Average consumer deposits increased seasonally by $2 billion or 1%.
Overall, our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased 8 basis points linked quarter to 12 basis points. Deposit betas have lagged early in the rate rising cycle, but we expect our deposit betas to accelerate in the third quarter and throughout the remainder of the year, given our increased rate forecast. And as a result, we now expect our betas to approach 30% by year-end, compared to our previous expectation of 22%. Slide 7 details our securities portfolio.
On an average basis, our securities grew $800 million or 1% during the quarter, representing a slower pace of reinvestment in light of the rapidly rising interest rate environment. The yield on our securities portfolio increased 25 basis points to 1.89%, driven by higher reinvestment yields, as well as lower premium amortization. On a spot basis, our securities remained relatively stable during the second quarter as net purchases were largely offset by net unrealized losses on the portfolio. As Bill mentioned, in total, we now have 60% of our securities and held to maturity as of June 30, which will help mitigate future AOCI impacts from rising interest rates.
Net pre-tax unrealized losses on the securities portfolio totaled $8.3 billion at the end of the second quarter. This includes $5.4 billion related to securities transferred to held to maturity, which will accrete back over the remaining lives of those securities. Turning to the income statement on Slide 8. As you can see, second quarter 2022 reported net income was $1.5 billion, or $3.39 per share, which included pre-tax integration costs of $14 million.
Excluding integration costs, adjusted EPS was $3.42. Revenue was up $424 million or 9% compared with the first quarter. Expenses increased $72 million or 2%, resulting in 7% positive operating leverage linked quarter. Provision was $36 million, and our effective tax rate was 18.5%.
Now, let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Slide 9 details our revenue trends. Total revenue for the second quarter of $5.1 billion increased 9% or $424 million linked quarter. Net interest income of $3.1 billion was up $247 million or 9%.
The benefit of higher yields on interest-earning assets and increased loan balances was partially offset by higher funding costs. And as a result, net interest margin increased 22 basis points to 2.5%. Second quarter fee income was $1.9 billion, an increase of $211 million or 13% linked quarter. Looking at the detail of each category.
Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 11. Overall, we saw broad improvements across all categories. Nonperforming loans of $2 billion decreased $252 million or 11% compared to March 31st, and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies were $1.5 billion on June 30th, a $188 million decline linked quarter, reflecting lower consumer and commercial loan delinquencies, which included the resolution of acquisition-related administrative and operational delays.
Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $83 million, a decrease of $54 million linked quarter, driven by lower consumer net charge-offs, primarily within the auto portfolio. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans continues to be historically low at 11 basis points. And during the second quarter, our allowance for credit losses remained essentially stable, and our reserves now total $5.1 billion or 1.7% of total loans. In summary, PNC reported a solid second quarter, and we're well-positioned for the second half of 2022 as we continue to realize the potential of our coast-to-coast franchise.
We expect total noninterest expense to be stable to up 1%. And we expect third quarter net charge-offs to be between $125 million and $175 million. Considering our reported operating results for the first half of 2022, third quarter expectations, and current economic forecast for the full year 2022 compared to the full year 2021, we expect average loan growth of approximately 13% by an 8% loan growth on a spot basis. We expect total revenue growth to be 9% to 11%.
Our revenue outlook for the full year is unchanged from the guidance we provided in April. However, relative to our expectations at that time, we now expect more net interest income from higher rates, offset by somewhat lower fees. We expect expenses, excluding integration expense, to be up 4% to 6%. And we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.",22.0,Medium
QCOM,2022,1,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Based on our performance over the past several quarters and the strong fiscal second-quarter guidance, it is clear that our strategy is working. Demand for our products and solutions continues to accelerate as our one technology road map is driving the growth of premium Android smartphones, as well as enabling the connected intelligent edge, which is driving digital transformation for the cloud-connected economy.
As you can see from our results today, strong performance in our chipset and licensing business led to record fiscal first-quarter revenues of $10.7 billion and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.23. Our chipset business had its second consecutive quarter of record performance with revenues of $8.8 billion, EBIT of $3.1 billion, and EBIT margin of 35%. Notably, QCT revenues exceeded those of any fabless semiconductor company. These results demonstrate the continued success of our diversification strategy.
This partnership includes custom AR chips to enable a new wave of power-efficient, lightweight AR glasses to deliver rich and immersive experiences, as well as plans to integrate our Snapdragon Spaces XR developer platform into Microsoft mesh. We're also very pleased that Time Magazine named our Snapdragon XR2 platform as one of the best inventions of 2021. And we're seeing strong support for our VR and AR platforms from virtually all ecosystem providers, OEMs, and content creators. In edge networking, we continue to lead in current and next-generation high-performance Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E solutions, which now make up more than 80% of our WiFi access point revenues.
In industrial, we're still in the early phases of digital transformation across many industries. And demand for our solutions continues to accelerate. As an example, combined smart utility meter, tracking robotics, and retail revenues more than double over the last year. In robotics, specifically, we expect total fiscal '22 product launches using our platforms to increase by over 50% year over year, spanning applications from warehouse automation to public safety, delivery services, and in-home assistance.
Building on our success in handsets, we're seeing traction with our modem-to-antenna solution across automotive and IoT. As examples, we're well-positioned to address up to $30 of 5G RF content per vehicle, and we're also intersecting our RF front-end road map with Wi-Fi 7. In automotive, Qualcomm is becoming the technology partner of choice for the industry, and we're enabling the transition of the automobile to a digital cloud-connected platform. Our innovative Snapdragon digital chassis is an open and scalable cloud-enabled platform for telematics, connectivity, digital cockpit, and ADAS, and uniquely position us as the leading system solution provider for silicon, software, systems, and services across multiple domains.
Lastly, demand remains strong across all of our technologies and continues to exceed supply. Despite ongoing challenges across the global supply chain, our multi-sourcing and capacity expansion initiatives will provide incremental improvements to our supply throughout the year. I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.
For QCT, these reflect the seasonality following Chinese New Year purchases and the launch of our new Snapdragon premium chipset in the second quarter. We expect the next inflection point in QCT to be in the second half of the calendar year, with launch of new 5G handsets across several major OEMs. Lastly, we published our annual corporate responsibility and ESG report yesterday, which outlines progress against our companywide targets, including environmental sustainability, diversity and inclusion, and power efficiency of our Snapdragon products. We are pleased to have been recognized by several organizations, including making the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and Newsweek's most responsible company list for the third consecutive year.",17.0,Low
QCOM,2022,2,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. As we shared at our Investor Day last November, Qualcomm is at the intersection of transformative trends that are generating demand for our broad technology portfolio across virtually every industry. This is creating strong growth and diversification opportunities beyond handsets.
In RF front end, we continue to drive 5G modem RF leadership. Our fifth generation modem RF system now implements advanced features such as AI integration, millimeter wave and sub-6 dual connectivity in 5G sub-6 care aggregation with FDD and TDD spectrum. Looking forward, in addition to growth in handsets, we're expanding RF front end into automotive and IoT. In our licensing business, revenues of $1.6 billion were above the midpoint of our guidance driven by the most valuable patent portfolio in the industry, and we continue to develop and patent new essential innovations for future releases of 5G and beyond.
Handset revenues of $6.3 billion increased 56% versus a year ago quarter. The upside relative to guidance was driven by increased volume in premium tier and improved supply. We gained share in Samsung's flagship device, the Galaxy S22, demonstrating leadership of our Snapdragon processor technology and our ability to compete with internal chipset initiatives. RF front-end revenues of $1.2 billion grew 28% versus the year ago quarter on increased adoption of our products across major OEMs.
We saw accelerated growth across IoT and automotive as we align supply to better meet the demand for our products. IoT revenues were up 61% year over year to $1.7 billion primarily on increased demand for our chipsets for connected intelligent edge devices. We saw strong performance across consumer, edge networking and industrial with each of these categories growing by more than 50% compared to the year ago quarter. We achieved record automotive revenues of $339 million, a growth of 41% versus the year ago period, driven by launches with our digital cockpit platforms.
With the strong adoption of our Snapdragon digital chassis, we have now increased our overall design win pipeline to greater than $16 billion. Lastly, during the quarter, we announced a 10% increase in our dividends and returned $1.7 billion in dividends and stock repurchases. Our strong free cash flow has positioned us to deliver attractive capital returns that are among the highest in the semiconductor industry while maintaining flexibility for strategic investments. Before turning to guidance, I will provide an update on the Arriver acquisition.
On a sequential basis, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth in IoT and automotive and a seasonal reduction in handsets and RF front end. Our strong forecast for QCT is driven by the same factors which benefited our second quarter, including gains in handset premium tier volume, strong demand in IoT and automotive and supply improvements. We anticipate non-GAAP operating expenses to be up 5% to 7% sequentially, reflecting select investments in product road map. In closing, we are pleased with our financial results and strong execution as we manage to supply constraints in the current macroeconomic environment.
Our QCT handset revenues are on track to grow by greater than 50% in fiscal '22. And we are well-positioned for fiscal '23 as we continue to benefit from increased processor content and share gains. While we strengthen our mobile leadership, diversification is the top priority for the company as evidenced by increasing design win pipeline in automotive and accelerating revenue growth in IoT. Thank you.",17.0,Low
QCOM,2022,3,"This license agreement is a significant QTL milestone event. Samsung is the world's largest smartphone supplier by unit volume with a well-developed portfolio of patents. The extended license agreement with Samsung demonstrates the tremendous ongoing value of our patent portfolio, our innovation and our long-standing leadership in driving the important and foundational elements of the mobile road map. The extended Samsung license agreement is an important benchmark for the long term and adds significantly to the stability of the QTL program going forward.
We believe the Qualcomm AI Stack portfolio is a revolutionary step in scaling high-performance, low-power on-device AI processing. These solutions demonstrate how our one technology road map is transforming Qualcomm from a wireless communications company for the mobile industry to a connected processor company for the intelligent edge. Lastly, as we continue to move forward and execute on our strategy, we're mindful of the challenging economic environment, and we remain disciplined on investments that drive sustainable differentiation and stockholder value. We are focused on customers and industries that drive stable long-term growth.
We will demonstrate how the Snapdragon Digital Chassis is enabling the transformation of the automobile and continuing to drive growth in our design win pipeline. I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.
QTL revenues of $1.5 billion and EBT margin of 71% were at the midpoint of guidance. These results reflect a decrease in handset volume in mid- and low tiers offset by favorable mix. QCT recorded revenues of $9.4 billion and EBT margin of 32%, both at the midpoint of our guidance and reflecting revenue growth of 45% and EBT dollar growth of 67% versus the year ago quarter. Handset revenues of $6.1 billion increased 59% year over year, driven by the strength of our Snapdragon product portfolio, especially in the premium and high tiers.
Consistent with our guidance, RF front-end revenues of $1 billion, grew 9% versus the year ago quarter on increased adoption of our broad product portfolio. IoT revenues were up 31% year over year to $1.8 billion. We saw strong performance across Edge networking and industrial IoT with combined revenue growth of more than 40%. We delivered another record quarter in automotive with revenues of $350 million with year-over-year growth of 38% driven by launches with our digital cockpit products.
Looking forward to global 3G, 4G, 5G handset forecast. We now expect calendar '22 global handsets to decrease by mid-single-digit percentage on a year-over-year basis, including 650 million to 700 million 5G handsets. Our guidance reflects the continuation of the trends that adversely impacted handset volumes exiting the June quarter. We expect the elevated uncertainty in the global economy and the impact of COVID measures in China will cause customers to act with caution in managing their purchases in the second half of calendar '22.
In the fourth fiscal quarter, we are forecasting revenues of $11 billion to $11.8 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $3 to $3.30. The midpoint of our guidance includes an estimated impact of approximately $0.20 due to the macroeconomic headwinds and the reduction in the global handset forecast I just outlined. We are forecasting QTL revenues of $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion and EBT margins of 69% to 73%, reflecting normal sequential unit growth. In QCT, we expect revenues of $9.5 billion to $10.1 billion and EBT margins of 32% to 34%.
At the midpoint, this implies year-over-year revenue growth of 27% and EBT dollar growth of 31%. On a sequential basis, we expect growth across QCT handset and automotive revenue streams. In handsets, while Snapdragon premium tier volume remains resilient, our guidance assumes lower demand in other tiers, reflecting the updated global handset forecast. In IoT, we are seeing strength across industrial and enterprise, which is offset by pockets of weakness in consumer products.
With this agreement, the QTL forecast that we provided at investor day remains unchanged. In closing, while we are mindful of the current environment, our long-term fundamentals are intact. We remain focused on driving growth by executing on our vision to bring cloud connectivity, data processing and artificial intelligence to the edge. Thank you, and back to you, Mauricio.",17.0,Low
QCOM,2022,4,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Fiscal '22 has been a strong year for Qualcomm with record performance in our chipset business and a strong execution of our diversification and growth strategy. We remain focused on continuing to transition Qualcomm from a wireless communications company for the mobile industry to a connected processor company for the intelligent edge.
In handsets, we entered into a new multiyear agreement with Samsung, expanding the use of Snapdragon platforms for future premium Samsung Galaxy products globally. We also executed on the changing OEM landscape opportunity, securing key premium and high-tier design wins with our customers in China. Snapdragon has become synonymous with premium mobile experiences worldwide. In automotive, our design win pipeline across connectivity, digital cockpit, and ADAS is now greater than $30 billion.
In licensing, we extended our agreement with Samsung through 2030, establishing an important benchmark for the long term and for future renegotiations. In addition to delivering record financial results, our fiscal '22 achievements validate our strategy and have provided a strong foundation for long-term growth. As we look to fiscal '23, further deterioration of the macroeconomic environment and extended China COVID restrictions have resulted in demand weakness and temporary elevated channel inventory across the industry. As good stewards of capital for our stockholders, we are committed to managing our business in light of the current environment without losing sight of the significant growth opportunities ahead.
And we are in a strong position to manage the near-term headwinds. Beyond 2023, we see a number of our strategic growth initiatives increasing in scale. We anticipate automotive revenues will grow consistent with our Auto Investor Day projections as the design win pipeline materializes. We expect to see an inflection point in Windows on Snapdragon PCs in 2024 based on a significant number of design wins to date.
We remain confident in our ability to navigate the current economic downturn given our strong balance sheet and consistent history of strong free cash flow generation. We will continue to focus on stockholder returns and executing on our ongoing diversification opportunities. The powerful secular tailwinds driving multiyear demand for our One Technology Roadmap across multiple end industries are unchanged and resilient. We remain on track to expand our addressable market by more than seven times to approximately $700 billion in the next decade and firmly establish Qualcomm as the connected processor company for the intelligent edge.
Handset revenues of $6.6 billion increased 40% versus the year-ago quarter on strength of our Snapdragon product portfolio across premium and high tiers. As expected, RF front-end revenues of $992 million were impacted by the continued weakness of the handset market and channel inventory. IoT revenues were up 24% year over year to $1.9 billion on growth across edge networking and industrial IoT. Automotive revenues of $427 million grew 58% versus the year-ago quarter due to the broad adoption of our Snapdragon Digital Chassis.
This rapid deterioration in demand and easing of supply constraints across the semiconductor industry have resulted in elevated channel inventory. Due to these elevated levels, our largest customers have made significant changes to their inventory policy. They are now drawing down on their inventory, negatively impacting our near-term financial performance. Based on our current assessment, we estimate that there are roughly eight to 10 weeks of elevated inventory in the channel.
While the environment is very dynamic, based on the information we have today, we believe this may take a couple of quarters to work itself through with more than half of the inventory drawdown completed in the first fiscal quarter. We are confident in our ability to navigate this environment successfully, and we'll continue to monitor inventory levels and order patterns closely. As Cristiano outlined, while we navigate this downturn, we've already implemented specific actions to manage our spending levels, including a hiring freeze and reductions in handsets, other mature product areas, and SG&A. We will remain disciplined and be prepared to take further decisive actions on additional reductions to operating expenses if the macroeconomic environment continues to deteriorate.
Turning to guidance for the first fiscal quarter. We are forecasting revenues of $9.2 billion to $10 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.25 to $2.45. The midpoint of our guidance includes an estimated impact of approximately $2 billion in revenue and $0.80 in EPS related to the drawdown of channel inventory with the remaining impact primarily due to weaker end-market demand and foreign exchange headwinds. In QCT, we expect revenues of $7.7 billion to $8.3 billion and EBT margins of 26% to 28%.
Following the record performance in fourth quarter, we expect our handsets and IoT revenue streams to be down sequentially due to the impacts I just described. On a year-over-year basis, we still expect revenue growth across IoT and automotive. We estimate QTL revenues of $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion and EBT margins of 71% to 75%. This estimate reflects the updated handset forecast, including a muted seasonal benefit for the holiday quarter and approximately $50 million headwind from foreign exchange on a year-over-year basis.
Beyond this, there are no changes to our planning assumption, and we are assuming minimal contribution from Apple product revenues in fiscal '25. In closing, while the current backdrop presents near-term headwinds for our industry, we remain confident in our leading technology road map, deep customer relationships, and strong balance sheet to help us navigate these challenges and maintain our leadership position. Our diversification strategy and long-term growth opportunities remain intact as we continue to drive our vision to bring cloud connectivity, data processing, and artificial intelligence to the edge. Thank you.",17.0,Low
QCOM,2023,1,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In fiscal Q1, despite the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and short-term challenges impacting the semiconductor industry, we deliver revenues of $9.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $2.37 per share, including year-over-year growth in QCT Automotive in IoT. UCT revenues of $7.9 billion were down 11% year over year as a result of weaker handset demand and inventory drawdown.
In handsets, our recently announced Snapdragon Gen 2 mobile platform begins a new era of AI accelerated experiences for smartphones. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 includes our first-ever AI-powered camera processor that enables real-time semantic segmentation for photos and videos. A dedicated 5G AI processor that can enhance 5G data speeds, coverage, latency, and battery life and an updated general purpose AI engine with a larger Tensor accelerator for increased formats. We are also pleased to enable the awards first satellite base two-way capable messaging solution for Android smartphones.
Snapdragon satellite will provide global connectivity for messaging, utilizing a readings weather-resilient LBN spectrum, and will initially be available on next-generation premium smartphones using Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 within the second half of 2023. Yesterday, I was pleased to join Samsung's Unpacked event, where they launched the Galaxy S-23 family of smartphones, powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen-2 mobile platform for Galaxy globally. This premium platform features accelerated performance and unique customizations made possible by our expanded strategic partnership with Samsung. The Galaxy S23 represents the first smartphone announced from this partnership.
The QCX-216 reduces power consumption by up to 80% and versus the previous generation solution while also enabling customers to design modules with an up to 40% lower cost structure. In retail, our point-of-sale solutions continue to drive the transition from traditional terminals to full-feature android-based terminals. We have shipped over 70 million Snapdragon devices since 2016 into handheld and desktops point-of-sale terminals worldwide. In enterprise video collaboration, we're leading this rapidly growing segment, powering many of the key OEMs such as Poly, Logitech, Net, Cisco, Both, Ever, and Alibaba.
These are just a few examples of our traction within industrial, and we remain excited about the growth prospects as digital transformation accelerates. In summary, the overall long-term growth opportunity for Qualcomm remains unchanged as demand for technology extends to virtually every device at the edge. Our track record of innovation provides a unique perspective and capability to be at the forefront of the digital transformation across new and diverse end markets. I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were lower than our guidance, decreasing 6% sequentially, which includes the benefit of certain cost actions we outlined last quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong with $8.2 billion in cash and marketable securities at the end of the first fiscal quarter. In addition, we expect to receive a majority of the transaction price of $1.5 billion on the completion of the sale of Veoneer's active safety business to Magna, BiSSW Partners. We expect the transaction to close by the end of the fiscal year.
We returned $2.1 billion to stockholders, including $1.3 billion in stock repurchases and $842 million in dividends in line with our capital return program. Lastly, our GAAP EPS results included a $0.10 benefit from the U.S. tax requirement to capitalize and amortize R&D expenses. This benefit is excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Before turning to second fiscal quarter guidance, I'll provide an update on short-term cyclical headwinds facing the semiconductor industry. The environment continues to be dynamic with challenging macroeconomic conditions and COVID headwinds in China, driving industrywide demand weakness. Given this uncertainty, we are incorporating a negative bias for 3G, 4G, 5G handset volumes for calendar '23 relative to calendar '22. The impact of broadening demand weakness across handsets and IoT products and the easing of supply constraints has contributed to elevated channel inventory.
Our diversification strategy is on track, as evidenced by our design win pipeline across IoT and automotive customers. In addition, our long-term secular growth opportunity remains unchanged. We are focused on executing on our strategy, enabled by our leading technology road map and best-in-class product portfolio. Thank you.",17.0,Low
RMD,2022,1,"We are dealing with an unprecedented, what I would call, perfect storm of elements, including the COVID recovery but also including a competitor recall that's ten-fold higher than any in the industry to date, and supply chain constraints that are impacting not only our industry but multiple industries worldwide. I'm incredibly proud of ResMedians across our global teams, many of whom are working 24/7 to get our products and solutions into the hands of patients who need them most. Despite these extraordinary efforts, we know that we have not been able to meet all of the demand. As such, the market leader, our competitor, that is in the not No.
Given the supply chain crisis, our suppliers have been allocating components to us on the inbound side. We have, in turn, been forced to allocate our products on the outbound side to our customers. We have been clear on the guiding principles for that allocation of our products. Namely that we are giving priority for production and delivery of these devices to meet the needs of the highest acuity patients first.
The allocation conversations that I have with our customers are the same ones that I am having with my suppliers and their suppliers and so on up the supply chain. As an example, during the quarter, I was on a Zoom call with one of our suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, and I'm not kidding. We have achieved the goal with that manufacturer and we received increased allocation from that manufacturer. But then we face the challenge, and are still facing it, of working with the five customers of theirs.
All the way down that chain to get to us to ensure that the agreed upon increased allocation of that component actually gets to ResMed, gets manufactured into ResMed products, and then sent to ResMed customers and ultimately to patients. That's just one example of a high degree of difficulty dive for our supply chain team. The supply chain analyses and negotiations are ongoing, and the situation is very, very fluid, and changing day by day, week by week and month by month. We have an incredible Six Sigma Black Belt laden team of supply chain specialists working on these issues 24/7.
In short, supply bottlenecks continue to restrict our access to critical electronic components, especially semiconductor chips, that ultimately limit our net production output. In addition to component supply issues, the ongoing challenges of seafreight and airfreight from manufacturing facilities to the distribution warehouses, and ultimately, the customers are increasing our costs and further impacting our ability to respond as rapidly as we want to the huge demand for ResMed products. The combination of component shortages and transportation bottlenecks makes providing steady and smooth flow of products to the market very difficult. We are working incredibly closely with our global supply chain partners, doing everything we can to gain access to additional supply of the critical components that we need further increase production of our medical devices.
Our market-leading R&D team accelerated the launch of this amazing innovation. So, first, by expanding the controlled product launch to additional customers and then accelerating to an earlier full product launch date to bring this product to market faster. Globally, we continue to sell our market-leading legacy platform, the AirSense 10, to be able to maximize the total volume of CPAP, APAP, and bi-levels available for customers. Clearly, the ongoing adoption of both the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11 platforms remains very, very strong.
We are uniquely positioned, and we have created this differentiated value for ResMed with our SaaS portfolio. We are set up for sustainable growth through ongoing innovation investments, commercial excellence partnerships and future acceleration through strategic M&A as well as selective tuck-in M&A opportunities. Looking at the portfolio of ResMed's business across sleep and respiratory care as well as our SaaS solutions, and we remain confident in our long-term strategy and our pipeline of innovative solutions. Our patient-centric, physician-centric, and provider-centric approach, combined with our unique ResMed culture means that we are well positioned to continue winning in the vastly underserved respiratory medical markets of sleep apnea, COPD, asthma, and other chronic diseases.
We again made excellent progress toward that goal this quarter. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude and thanks to the more than 8,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work, and dedication during these ongoing and unprecedented times. You, our ResMed team, have helped save the lives of many hundreds if not thousands of people around the world with COVID-19 with those emergency needs these last 18 months. And you are now, and you have now already, pivoted back to provide ongoing support for all our customers during some of the most challenging industry dynamics that we've seen in the industry.
Group revenue for the September quarter was $904 million, an increase of 20%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 19%. Revenue growth reflected increased demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices, driven by both sleep patient flow recovering from COVID-19 impacted reduced levels experienced in the prior year quarter and by increased demand in response to the recent product recall by one of our competitors. In the September quarter, we estimate the incremental revenue from COVID-19-related demand was approximately $4 million, compared to $40 million estimated incremental revenue from the COVID-19-related demand in the prior year quarter.
For the balance of fiscal year '22, we expect several factors will drive demand, including the general recovery of the global sleep market from COVID-19 impacts, the ongoing launch of our next-generation AirSense 11 platform into markets and geographies, and share gains during our competitors' recall. However, as reported last quarter, while we are working hard to increase manufacturing output, we will not be able to meet the expected demand resulting from our competitors' recall, primarily because of significant and ongoing supply constraints for electronic components. And so as Mick discussed earlier, we're operating a very dynamic supply chain environment. Based on the latest information available, we continue to expect component supply constraints will limit the incremental device revenue resulting from competitor's recall to somewhere between $300 million and $350 million for fiscal year 2022.
Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $281 million, an increase of 18%, underpinned by strong revenue growth. During the quarter, we finalized the deed of settlement with the Australian Taxation Office, or ATO, covering transit pricing audits for the years 2009 through 2018, and also agreed on transfer pricing principles for the future. And in anticipation of this settlement, we had previously estimated and recorded an accounting tax reserve of $249 million, net of credits and deductions in our FY '21 financial results. In relation to the conclusion of the settlement in the current quarter, we recorded an additional GAAP tax expense of $4 million associated with lower tax credits, which were driven by foreign currency movements.
So, on a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 21.3% while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%. Looking forward, we estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fiscal year '22 will be in the range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $222 million, and an increase of 20%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.51, an increase of 19%.
Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $204 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.39. We had negative cash flow from operations for the quarter of $66 million due to the payment of about $285 million to the Australian Taxation Office associated with the deed of settlement. After adjusting for this payment, our operating cash flow for the quarter was $219 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by increases in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $27 million.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter September totaled $39 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $61.2 million. We recorded equity losses of $1.4 million in our income statement in the September quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to then report equity losses of approximately $2 million per quarter through the balance of fiscal year '22 associated with the joint venture operations.
We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $276 million. At September 30, we had $806 million of gross debt and $530 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest, and at September 30, we had almost $1.5 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong.",26.0,
RMD,2022,2,"Hello, and welcome to the ResMed second quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, vice president, investor relations and corporate communications. Please go ahead, Amy.
I'm very proud of 8,000 ResMedians serving patients in 140 countries worldwide. Our global teams are finding ways to deliver products and solutions to home care providers, physicians and healthcare systems and ultimately into the hands of patients who need them most. Clearly, the global supply chain environment remains very challenging across multiple industries, and we are not immune to its impact. During the quarter, despite growing double digits year-on-year, we were not able to meet all the demand available in the market.
We have being allocated components from our suppliers, particularly electronic components and even more specifically, semiconductor chips, and we are thus being forced to allocate our outbound products to our customers. We have established an allocation process with clear guiding principles that give priority to the production and delivery of devices to meet the needs of the highest acuity patients first. In addition to component supply issues, the ongoing challenges of sea freight and air freight are impacting our ability to respond as rapidly as we would like to the demand for ResMed products. Freight costs are increasing across the board on inbound components from suppliers and on outbound products to our distribution centers and for ultimate delivery to our customers.
As a result of these increased costs, we implemented a surcharge on our products starting in January to share some of the burden of these increased costs with customers. Given all the increase in prices from commodities to specialty products across multiple industries around the world, the necessity of this surcharge has been understood and accepted by our customers. We are working closely with our global supply chain partners doing everything that we can to gain access to additional supply of the critical components that we need to further increase production of our medical devices. We are also reengineering designs validating new parts, pieces, supplies and accelerating new product launch and development to further catch up with the demand.
launch of our next-generation device platform called AirSense 11 continues to go very well. This new platform has provided much needed additional product supply as we face all-time high demand for ResMed devices. We expect to introduce the AirSense 11 platform into additional countries throughout calendar year 2022. In parallel, we will continue to sell our globally available market-leading platform, the AirSense 10, to maximize the total volume of CPAP, APAP and bilevels available for sale.
In fact, we are seeing more than double the uptake of patients signing up to myAir and fully engaging with ResMed software technology. The net result is that this delivers a better patient experience, better efficiency for the home care providers and more importantly, greater long-term adherence to therapy. We saw this demonstrated in the Alaska study in partnership with the French healthcare systems, where we showed in a study with over 176,000 patients that those patients who had adhered to CPAP therapy had a 39% relative reduction in mortality rates versus control. Demonstrating these types of better patient outcomes and lower costs for the healthcare system at a scale not seen before in the industry are critical components of the ResMed 2025 strategy.
Another key aspect of our long-term growth strategy is driving awareness and increasing the flow of patients through the top of the sleep apnea diagnosis funnel. COVID-19 has advanced awareness, adoption and acceptance of respiratory health and respiratory hygiene but also adoption and acceptance of digital health and telehealth tools, including home-based sleep apnea tests. Although increasing demand is not as important in the immediate short term, given the ongoing competitor recall, we have a long-term focus, and we're always focused on that long-term demand gen opportunity. We are innovating with partners and our customers to create an even more efficient and effective approach to sleep apnea patient identification, screening, diagnostics, treatment and management.
Our sleep and respiratory care solutions treat the most prevalent and highest cost chronic conditions, and our SaaS solutions support the care settings where people face these and other chronic conditions. With this combination, we can fundamentally transform out-of-hospital healthcare at a scale that no other company can match. And we are set up for sustainable growth through ongoing investments in R&D to the tune of 7% of our revenues, commercial excellence in partnerships with CVS, Verily and beyond, as well as future acceleration through strategic M&A, as well as tuck-in M&A as we move forward. Our patient-centric physician-centric and provider-centric approach, combined with our unique ResMed culture, means that we are positioned to continue winning in the vastly underserved medical markets of sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and beyond.
We're pleased with our financial performance in Q2 despite the headwinds we faced as a result of significant ongoing supply chain constraints in a challenging freight environment. Group revenue for the December quarter was $895 million, an increase of 12%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 13%. Revenue growth reflects increased demand for our sleep and respiratory care products across our portfolio, driven by recovering market conditions and by increased device demand in response to the ongoing product recall by one of our competitors.
For the first half of FY '22, this reflects incremental revenue in the range of $125 million to $145 million. We continue to expect component supply constraints will limit the total incremental device revenue opportunity to somewhere between $300 million and $350 million for the full fiscal year 2022. As we shared last quarter, we expect our fiscal third quarter to remain supply constrained similar to our fiscal second quarter, therefore, limiting incremental revenue during the third quarter. We see supply challenges to some extent easing in our fiscal fourth quarter and into fiscal year 2023.
Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries increased by 14%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 12% in constant currency terms. By product segment, Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 16%, while masks and other sales increased by 10%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 19%, as we benefited from incremental revenue due to a competitor's recall and favorable product mix as we sold an increased proportion of higher acuity devices.
This is consistent with our guiding principles for product allocation, namely that we are giving priority to the production and delivery of our devices to meet the needs of the high security patients first. Masks and other sales increased by 9%, reflecting solid resupply revenue and achieved despite the challenging device supply environment, which continues to limit new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales increased by 13% in constant currency terms, again reflecting the benefit from incremental revenue due to a competitor's recall. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets benefited from improved patient flow relative to the prior year and increased by 11% in constant currency terms.
However, as we have said for the last few quarters, while we are working hard to increase device output, we will not be able to meet all the expected demand resulting from our competitors' recall, primarily because of significant and ongoing supply constraints for electronic components. We are operating in a very dynamic supply chain environment. As I stated earlier, we continue to expect component supply constraints will limit the incremental device revenue resulting from our competitors' recall to somewhere between $300 million and $350 million for fiscal year '22. This includes the device revenue we were able to generate in the first half of fiscal year '22.
The decrease is predominantly attributable to higher freight component and manufacturing costs and unfavorable currency movements, partially offset by positive product mix, particularly in relation to strong growth of our higher acuity devices. Moving on to operating expenses. During Q2, we maintained a disciplined approach in our ongoing spend to support our operations. But we are seeing a more normalized expenditure profile as COVID-19 impacts subside.
Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter increased by 5%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by the contraction of our gross margin. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 15%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.6% compared to the prior year quarter of 15.2%. The relatively low tax rate in Q2 in both the current quarter and prior year quarter reflects a favorable tax benefit associated with employee equity investing that typically occurs in the second quarter. Looking forward, we estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the full fiscal year '22 will be in the range of 19% to 20%.
Our non-GAAP net income for the quarter increased by 5% and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter increased by 4%. Our cash flow from operations for the quarter was $220 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by higher working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $30 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $41 million.
During the quarter, we paid dividends to shareholders totaling $61 million. We recorded equity losses of $1.9 million in our income statement in the December quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $2 million per quarter through the balance of fiscal year '22 associated with the joint venture operation. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $194 million.
At December 31, we had $680 million in gross debt and $486 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. And at December 31, we had approximately $1.6 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong.",26.0,
RMD,2022,3,"Hello, and welcome to the Q3 fiscal year 2022 ResMed call. My name is Kevin, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, vice president of investor relations and corporate communications.
Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review results for the third quarter of our fiscal year 2022 ended March 31st. Our third quarter results reflect strong performance across our business with double-digit revenue growth in our sleep and respiratory care business and high single-digit growth in our Software-as-a-Service segment. Our growth is the direct result of our global team's ability to pivot and drive for results even as we continue to manage through several external challenges that are impacting our business, including one, ongoing supply chain disruptions; two, COVID restrictions in parts of the world; three, recovering post-COVID peak patient flows; and four, unprecedented demand from a competitor recall, which will keep them out of the market at least through the end of the calendar year. The global supply chain environment remains very challenging across multiple industries.
This work includes a combination of a number of workstreams: one, shoring up the flow of existing parts from existing suppliers; two, establishing flow of existing parts from new suppliers; three, validating new parts from existing suppliers; and four, validating and verifying new parts from new suppliers as we review and redesign across key devices in our portfolio. In addition, we have the fifth line of work. So it's five lines of work, and that fifth line is reengineering designs to eliminate and/or mitigate the top bottlenecks to achieve greater flow through our supply chain. The most significant example of a project in this fifth line of work is our newly released AirSense 10 card to cloud device.
This device eliminates the No. 1 bottleneck of the 3G, 4G comms chip while facilitating secure data upload to our cloud-based software platform called AirView so that providers and physicians can access the data and better manage the patient. We've already begun to offer AirSense 10 card to cloud devices in select markets to some customers, and we will be ramping up from there. With these five lines of work continuing in parallel, we have been able to offset some of the impact of continuing component shortages and de-commits to help us better support patients, providers, and physicians.
We recognize that this is a very difficult situation for all of our customers, including physicians who feel the pressure from their patients, home medical equipment providers who see this every day in their businesses, but also payers and entire healthcare systems and especially the most important customer, the patient themselves. We are partnering across the industry to be the solutions provider to these problems. We expect a significant backlog of patients diagnosed and coming through the system to be present for at least the next 12 to 18 months with incredible associated demand. We are working to address this demand with these portfolio of supply projects and beyond.
China is a case in point right now with severe shutdowns in Shanghai and beyond. But across our portfolio, our global portfolio, we're in 140 countries that we serve. I expect that these metrics will steadily improve to pre-COVID patient levels and beyond as vaccines and boosters roll out globally and people remain focused on their personal respiratory health and hygiene. It's been a big learning through COVID.
market and beyond. The AirSense 11 has provided much needed additional product supply as we face all-time high demand for ResMed devices and it couldn't have launched at a better time for that purpose to help us mitigate ongoing component shortages. We will introduce the AirSense 11 into additional countries in the fourth quarter that we're in right now here of fiscal year 2022 and throughout fiscal 2023. In parallel, we will continue to sell our globally available market-leading platform, the AirSense 10, which is second in customer preference only to the AirSense 11.
They deliver better efficiencies for home care providers. And most importantly, they deliver greater long-term adherence to therapy by patients. Let me spend just a couple of minutes outlining some real-world evidence showing that greater therapy adherence leads to lower hospitalizations, lower mortality, and better clinical outcomes through mitigation of chronic disease. We are demonstrating better patient outcomes and lowering costs for the healthcare system at a scale not seen before in the industry.
With 1.6 billion people worldwide suffering from sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma, it's also our duty to do this. We are innovating with partners and our customers to create even more efficient and effective approaches to sleep apnea patient identification, screening, diagnostics, treatment, and management. We will continue to invest in technology that enable what we call an end-to-end seamless digital experience for patients. One example we recently rolled out is the next generation of our remote mask selector tool that makes mask selection and sizing easier and more effective by creating personalized mask recommendations based on a patient's health, sleep attributes, and their own facial measurements.
where providers shifted focus to supporting the most severe and highest acuity patients. This demand and the work of providers is aligned with the ResMed guiding principles of our allocation process specifically to give the highest priority to manufacturing life support ventilation. As I speak, we are not component constrained on our life support ventilator called Astral. Let me now review our Software as a Service business for out-of-hospital care.
Our focus is on personal care that is patient-centric, physician-centric, and provider-centric. This approach, combined with our unique ResMed culture means that we are positioned to continue winning in the vastly underserved medical markets of sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease asthma, and beyond. We are transforming out-of-hospital healthcare at scale, leading the market in digital health technology. As I said earlier, we have over 11.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud, and we have over 17 million cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide.
We are unlocking value by using de-identified data to help patients directly but also to help providers, physicians, payers, and entire healthcare systems. We have invested in the cybersecurity, the privacy, cloud operations as well as data analytics, including artificial intelligence, machine learning capabilities to do this at a scale unmatched by our competitors, and we are increasing our lead each and every day. Our two key software customer-facing products, AirView and myAir are now 100% managed in the cloud. So not only are our devices cloud connected and our software cloud-enabled, we here at ResMed as a company are cloud connected and cloud enabled.
We had solid financial performance in Q3 despite the headwinds we faced as a result of significant ongoing supply chain constraints in a challenging freight environment. Group revenue for the March quarter was $865 million, an increase of 12%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 14%. Revenue growth reflects increased demand for our sleep and respiratory care products across our portfolio driven by recovering market conditions and by increased device demand in response to the ongoing product recall by one of our competitors.
We continue to experience challenges in securing sufficient components, and this has hampered our ability to materially increase our supply of devices. We expect our fiscal fourth quarter to remain supply constrained and similar to our recent fiscal quarters, therefore, limiting incremental revenue during the fourth quarter. We now expect the total incremental device revenue opportunity for fiscal year 2022 will fall somewhere between $200 million and $250 million. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business, sales in U.S.
We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin declined by 150 basis points to 58.1% in the March quarter. The decrease is predominantly attributable to higher freight component and manufacturing costs partially offset by a positive product mix due to strong growth in our higher acuity devices and improvement in average selling prices following the introduction of the device surcharge. Moving on to operating expenses.
Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the balance of FY '22. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 19% or in constant currency terms increased by 22%. The R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.7%, compared to 7.3% in the prior-year quarter. We continue to make significant investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology product and solutions development will deliver a sustained competitive advantage.
Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of FY '22. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter increased by 5%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by the contraction of our gross margin and higher operating expenses. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 21.1%, compared to the prior-year quarter non-GAAP tax rate of 19.4%. Looking forward, we estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the full fiscal year '22 within the range of 19% to 20%.
Our non-GAAP net income for the quarter increased by 2% and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter also increased by 2%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $117 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings partially offset by higher levels of working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $48 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $42 million.
During the quarter, we paid dividends to shareholders totaling $61 million. We recorded equity losses of $2.6 million in our income statement in the March quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $2 million to $3 million per quarter for the balance of fiscal year '22 and into FY '23 associated with the joint venture operation. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $202 million.
At March 31, we had $681 million in gross debt and $479 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. And at March 31, we had approximately $1.6 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong.",26.0,

Thank you, Julie. I'm pleased to report that Rollins delivered solid first quarter results and realized strong year-over-year growth in many key performance areas. We remain well positioned to deliver on our short-term and long-term objectives, and we look forward to sharing our progress in the quarters ahead. I would now like to give an update on our SEC investigation.
It is noteworthy that the SEC recognizes within the order that Rollins ""cooperation and the remedial acts were properly undertaken to prevent and detect the type of misconduct described in the order."" Out of respect for the process, we will not answer any questions during our Q&A on this matter. I assure you that integrity is at the core of who we are as a company, and we remain committed to doing the right thing for our employees, investors, and customers. And finally, we are pleased that this matter is resolved. With that, let me turn the call over to John, who will provide some business updates.
She was also involved in the sale and distribution of those networks, the protection of intellectual property, employment matters as well as litigation and transactional work relating to acquisitions and joint ventures. Most recently, Louise focused on issues related to technology, information security, use of data, and consumer privacy as well as enterprisewide risk management. We are pleased to have Louise join our board, and we believe her broad experience will help to further strengthen Rollins and guide our strategic direction. At our core, we are foremost a service company.
Our track record of success is a direct result of the efforts of the dedicated and caring people that work at Rollins. Toward this end, I'd like to highlight that during the quarter, Rollins was awarded a 2022 Top Workplaces Award by the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Rollins now ranked 17th in the large business category, marking the sixth consecutive year we've received this award. This recognition is based solely on employee satisfaction and engagement feedback gathered through a third-party survey.
The survey measures several aspects of workplace culture, including alignment, execution, and leadership. More than 2,900 Atlanta companies participated in this program and over 68,000 of their employees were surveyed about their workplace experience. Another recent recognition that I'm particularly proud of is that Newsweek ranked Rollins No. 8 in their article on America's most trustworthy companies for 2022 in the consulting and professional services category.
As you may recall from last quarter, we've been proactively addressing supply chain issues in our termite and ancillary service offerings. With our procurement team seeking alternate products and suppliers, while our operation teams have been successfully initiated increases in our rate card pricing where needed to counteract the rise in some of these material costs. We believe we've struck the right balance and these efforts are helping to bring material costs back in line for our termite and ancillary business. In the first quarter, we began experiencing similar inflationary headwinds within our residential and commercial pest control materials and supplies.
Our fuel expense is an important example. We gave up 0.7 point in margin to increases in fleet expense in Q1. Through extensive routing and scheduling initiatives, we have reduced our overall mileage necessary, which lowers our fuel requirements. For our first quarter of 2022, our fuel costs would have been approximately $700,000 higher if we had not begun these routing and scheduling processes.
Fortunately, it's full. We have plenty of potential opportunities that we're actively engaged with. Our acquisition team has been busy, both domestic and internationally. One of our latest acquisitions highlighted in a recent press release, NBC Environment, headquartered in the U.K.
Combined, these fleet expense increases equated to 0.7 of a point in additional costs. Salaries were up 0.4 point, while pet control materials and supplies were up $2.9 million or 0.1 point. Fuel increases were driven by a 42% increase in average price paid per gallon in Q1 2022 over 2021. This, along with customer growth, brought a 55% increase in our total fuel costs for the quarter.
The service wages increase was a combination of COVID sick time taken and overtime paid to cover work for employees out sick with COVID. We faced some difficult challenges in January as our reported number of employees testing positive for COVID-19 increased 154% over January 2021. Additional overtime pay required to complete our routes and cover for these COVID cases contributed to a 21% increase over Q1 2021. We believe this to be a onetime event unless another COVID surge occurs.
As you probably noted, we've also increased our term loan over the last year. This will put us in a strong position to act quickly on either potential acquisitions or stock repurchases as opportunities may arise. Now to free cash flow. For the first quarter of 2022, our free cash was 79.5 million or a decrease of 28.8% over last year.",20.0,

Thank you, Julie. I'm very pleased to report that Rollins delivered a very strong financial performance in the second quarter and remains well positioned to deliver on our long-term business objectives. On today's call, I'm excited to share our strategic management succession plan that has been unanimously approved by our board of directors. We firmly believe that this is the right time to initiate this important leadership transition.
We have a proven management team, leading brands and a very strong culture. I'm extremely confident in the future of Rollins and look forward to working closely with Jerry to ensure a smooth transition of responsibilities. While I'll be moving away from the day-to-day operations, as I continue serving as our company chairman of the board, I will remain active and focused on our business goals and strategic plans. As many of you know, Jerry has been with Rollins since the 2008 acquisition of HomeTeam.
Consistent with that approach, we're continually looking to improve our employee benefits and I'm pleased to announce that Rollins has partnered with Everside Health to offer an on-site health center located at our Atlanta home office. This new health center offers convenient primary care services for everything from screenings and prevention to chronic disease management and urgent care for several thousand of our employees in the area. There are multiple benefits and features to this program, including same-day and next-day appointments, on-site lab draws, medications and immunizations, mental health services, and the ability to reach a care team 24/7 for urgent needs. In addition to our Atlanta facility, our U.S.
employees have access to over 70 Everside Health clinics, and we are live in 37 states for virtual primary care. The safety and well-being of our employees is a top priority. And we believe offering this new benefit will lead to better health outcomes, allowing employees to live healthier lives. Now let me turn the call over to Jerry, who will provide more details on our business.
The proof of this is in his actions and results. It's truly an honor to succeed Gary as CEO and lead this incredible company of more than 17,000 exceptional employees, each of whom brings a commitment to deliver the best for our customers every day. With Gary and John's continued guidance, I look forward to continuing to build on our great success as we begin this new chapter of the company's future. I'd now like to walk through our 2022 second quarter performance, focusing on items that directly impacted our operations during the period.
While we're efficiently navigating through this period and believe that our proactive initiatives have helped, we're keeping a watchful eye on inflationary pressures, fuel costs, and supply chain costs, and how they may affect Rollins. Management of fuel expense is a notable example. As we grow, we improved customer density. And when coupled with our routing and scheduling technology initiatives, we continue to reduce our overall mileage between service visits, which lowers our fuel requirements.
We saved over 5.8 million miles driven in the quarter or $1.3 million. This savings was slightly offset by increased average price per gallon over Q2 2021 of over $400,000, equating to net fuel savings of $875,000. This has also helped manage labor costs as our technicians have less unproductive windshield time, plus we've created a better job for them along the way. As we move through the second half of 2022, we expect we'll see the ongoing benefits of these improvements.
Furthermore, looking ahead, we're committed to enhancing the overall efficiency of our fleet while also reducing carbon emissions. In June, we announced that BMW Group ranked Rollins 15th out of the top 50 green fleets in the United States. This primarily reflects Rollins use of hybrid sedans that are being driven by our sales and management personnel. However, we recently began testing the use of light-duty hybrid trucks.
Given their excellent fuel economy, we are focused on having a sizable uptick in our hybrid truck fleet by 2024. Additionally, given recent technology advancements, we've been testing the use of battery-powered application equipment going from gas power to battery provides us with a compelling opportunity to reduce emissions without sacrificing the effectiveness of our service. We look forward to updating you on these initiatives in the quarters ahead. As you may recall from prior conference calls, we've been proactively addressing increased supply chain costs in our residential and commercial pest control materials and supplies.
This includes termite and ancillary service offerings as well. We have solid long-term working relationships with our manufacturers and have deep visibility into the supply process, often a few levels up in the supply chain. In doing so, we're often able to achieve greater operational efficiencies and overall flexibility by not only having materials shipped quickly but also having real-time insights advising us when we need to order materials. We continue to seek opportunities to diversify through alternative suppliers and actively seek shipping and freight efficiencies.
On the subject of pricing, we successfully implemented our annual price increase programs earlier this year. As mentioned on our last conference call, aggressive service price increases were initiated within all our brands during April and May as compared to historical timing of the early summer months and prior years. We are already realizing a notable benefit from this initiative more than doubling our traditional 1% to 2% net growth levels from our past price increase programs. Overall, we saw little resistance from our customers on the higher price increases put into place, which is a confirmation of service satisfaction.
Next, on our acquisition pipeline, it remains strong, and we have plenty of potential opportunities that we are actively pursuing. So far in 2022, we have completed 22 strategic acquisitions within the U.S., United Kingdom and Australia. In the U.K., we achieved an important milestone during the quarter with the acquisition of Europest. In addition to expanding our geographic footprint within the U.K., it is also our first location in Wales.
Strategically, we now have full coverage within the United Kingdom, as this tuck-in transaction comes on the heels of another recent U.K. acquisition, NBC Environment, which provided our first locations within Scotland. Moving forward, Strategic acquisitions will continue to be an important component in our initiatives to further grow and expand our business. Before I turn it over to Julie, I want to emphasize how pleased we are with Rollins second quarter results and that we remain well positioned for 2022.
Jerry, also watching your career grow from our early days at HomeTeam to President of Rollins has been exciting, and I have no doubt that you will excel in this new role. I appreciate your trust and leadership through the years and cannot wait to see what the future holds. So now onto the numbers. We delivered a strong second quarter highlighted by significant growth across many key financial metrics.
Second quarter 2022 gross margin decreased to 52.8% or 0.5 point below last year. As mentioned, fleet created another quarter of strong headwinds in Q2 2022 primarily from fuel presenting an increase of $6.8 million and vehicle repairs of $1.7 million over last year. Fuel increases were driven by over a 50% increase in our average price paid per gallon in Q2 2022 over 2021. Vehicle repairs were up due to the continued delay in receipt of new vehicles from the manufacturers.
Now for a few notes regarding our cash flow. Our dividends Q2 2022, totaled $49.2 million or an increase of 22% over 2021, while cash used for acquisitions increased 218.7% to $36.4 million for 2022. We ended the current period with $221 million in cash, of which, $62.9 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our free cash flow for Q2 was $119.4 million or an increase of 26.6% over last year.",20.0,

Thank you, Julie. I'm pleased to report that Rollins's third quarter performance was highlighted by continued growth in solid financials. As we look ahead, the company remains well-positioned to continue accomplishing our long-term business objectives. I'm also proud to welcome Rollins's new chief financial officer, Kenneth Krause.
Ken is a highly regarded business executive with more than two decades of financial and accounting experience. Ken is already contributing to our success. We welcome him to our team. Jerry, will you share more about Ken later? Let me now turn the call over to John Wilson, our vice chairman, who will provide some business updates.
This incredible team works hard every day to achieve our objectives and take great care of our customers. At Rollins, our people are our most valuable asset. Pursuant to that, we're always looking to improve our employee training and benefit offerings, as well as provide a workplace where they are respected and able to grow professionally. Last quarter, we announced a new partnership with Everside Health to offer an onsite health center providing primary care at our Atlanta home office and virtually nationally.
This new program offers free or reduced-cost primary care for all employees. We're pleased to share that since its opening four months ago, this effort has registered over 500 employee visits and filled over 300 prescriptions. We are very focused on enabling our employees to live healthier lives at home and at work while enjoying multiple benefits within this effort. With same-day and next-day appointments, this health center handles everything from routine screenings to chronic disease management.
It also offers onsite lab draws, medications, prescriptions, immunizations, and mental health services, as well as the ability to reach a care team 24/7 for urgent needs. Further, we plan to expand this free primary care offering to the covered dependents of our team members starting January 1st. Feedback to date has been extremely positive with a very high satisfaction rate. Ultimately, we believe that by providing easier access to these kinds of services, we are facilitating better health outcomes and happier, healthier employees.
Most importantly, we want to encourage employee ownership in Rollins as we want everyone to think and act like owners in our company. In summary, guided by our commitment to employees and our culture, we feel these types of benefit programs and improvements are important to our long-term success. Not only by retaining and incentivizing our valued employees at all levels and for them to have a vested interest in our performance, but also by effectively position Rollins Brands as a leading contender for top talent. Last, I would like to discuss Hurricane Ian.
Thank goodness all of our employees in Ian's path are safe, but they have needed assistance through our Rollins Employee Relief Fund, our team provided over 170 emergency grants to impacted employees within the first 10 days following the hurricane to enable team members to address essential needs. Since then, the relief team has been processing multiple full grants to address employees who have endured even greater hardship. Our hearts go out to those affected by the hurricane but must acknowledge how excited we were about all our team members who have jumped in to assist those impacted in various ways. They quickly volunteered their time and energy, often after work hours to gather, load, and deliver supplies to those most in need.
You'll hear from him in a little bit. But for anyone who hasn't had the pleasure of speaking with him yet, he is passionate about business, very experienced, and has a unique combination of strategic, operational, and financial expertise. We're extremely pleased to have him as a member of our leadership team. I'd now like to walk through our 2022 third quarter performance focusing on items that directly impacted our operations during the period.
During the last few conference calls, we've discussed various inflationary pressures, primarily fleet-related costs, specifically fuel and vehicle repairs, and materials and supplies. We've also provided insights into the proactive actions we've been implementing to mitigate these pressures. In this context, I'm pleased to note that during Q3 we're beginning to see a gradual improvement in fuel prices. We've also been reducing our overall mileage per service visit through routing and scheduling initiatives.
Looking ahead, we're told by our manufacturers that the supply environment is improving and that potentially we could expect an uptick in inflow levels for new vehicles in the coming quarters. As we received similar assurances last year, we're certainly keeping a watchful eye on this and we'll keep you updated on future conference calls. On the Labor side, even through the tight labor market, Rollins remains well-positioned in effectively attracting, retaining, and deploying talent by prioritizing employee well-being, workplace inclusion, and professional development opportunities while also providing attractive employee benefits offerings. We have a track record of being a premier destination for talent.
As we headed into peak hiring season this year, we successfully integrated a recruiting software platform to allow our hiring managers to more efficiently recruit and engage with potential new candidates. This talent recruitment platform makes it easier for prospective team members to explore open positions on our career portals and apply for open positions in just a few minutes and they can do so easily from a mobile device. Our hiring managers can more easily prescreen candidates, communicate with them, and schedule interviews in a more streamlined way. As a result of this new and improved process, we averaged 35,000 job applicant submittals per month for the third quarter.
And over the last five months, we have almost matched the total year 2021 application submittals. In short, by offering candidates an enhanced hiring experience, we've been able to successfully source and add qualified talent across the country despite the tight labor market. Next, I'd like to turn to acquisitions. Year to date, we've completed 27 acquisitions.
We are proud to welcome their more than 220 team members to Rollins. We continue to pursue potential opportunities as we look ahead to the remainder of the year and into 2023 our pipeline remains strong. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I want to emphasize how pleased we are with Rollins's strong third quarter performance. We're confident in our ability to continue driving growth and improving profitability in the business.
Let me start by highlighting a few key accomplishments in the quarter. First, revenue growth was strong, with organic revenue growing just under 9% on an as-reported basis. Second, EBITDA margins were healthy at 23.3%, up 10 basis points versus the same period a year ago. Despite incurring higher casualty reserve charges, these charges weighed down EBITDA margins by approximately 140 basis points in the quarter.
I will spend more time on the casualty reserve in a bit, but it was good to see the strong margin performance in this challenging inflationary period. Earnings per share improved by 15% to $0.22 per share. And free cash flow was very healthy with operating cash flow growing over 60% versus the same period a year ago. Let's now dive into the quarterly results in more detail.
Quarterly revenue was $730 million, up just over 12% on a reported basis. This includes approximately 4% of growth from acquisitions. Currencies reduce sales growth by 50 basis points on the stronger dollar, notably versus the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, and the British pound. It was good to see strong organic growth across our service lines.
GAAP net income was $108 million or $0.22 and earnings per share increased 15% versus the same period a year ago on the 12% increase in reported revenue. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, quarterly free cash flow was very strong in the quarter. We generated over $120 million of free cash flow on $108 million of earnings in the quarter. Free cash flow increased by over 60% in the quarter.
We made acquisitions totaling approximately $60 million in the third quarter and we paid just under $50 million in dividends. That remains negligible and debt to EBITDA is well below one time on a gross level. Cash balances approximated debt balances to the end of the quarter. Year to date, we have made acquisitions totaling just over $110 million and paid dividends of approximately 148 million.
Debt balances are down $30 million since the beginning of the year and cash is up over $16 million, finishing at $122 million the finished the third quarter. Speaking of dividends, we increased our regular quarterly dividend last night to $0.13 per share, an increase of 30% versus the third quarter a year ago. With this announcement, this will enable us to realize an increasing dividend again in 2022. We are well-positioned to continue to maintain our balanced approach to capital allocation.",20.0,

While we've only been together for two months, we're already starting to see validation of our investment thesis, and the results of our comprehensive planning are paying off. We've begun leveraging technology like Kensho across the broader organization to automate processes and increase efficiencies. We've begun development of several new products and features across the divisions. We're integrating our divisional commercial teams, and we've already closed synergy deals in multiple divisions.
We also heard a unified voice among our leadership in support of our People First initiatives and our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. We came away energized and full of confidence that we'll be able to take the absolute best, not only from each company but from each person in the organization and create something exceptional at S&P Global. I have never been more inspired by our people. And I'm more excited than ever to work with them to drive sustainable, profitable growth.
When we announced the merger in November 2020, we noted that we needed regulatory approval in multiple jurisdictions. We received final regulatory approval on February 25, 2022, and officially closed the merger three days later on February 28. We immediately went to work optimizing the capital structure, issuing $5.5 billion in new debt, most of which was used to refinance existing debt at lower rates. We completed that refinancing in April 2022.
Looking across the six divisions, I'm encouraged by the fact that even in a challenging macroeconomic environment, we were able to deliver strong revenue across five of our six divisions, including double-digit growth in commodity insights, mobility and indices. In line with the expectations we laid out on our call in March, we did see a year-over-year decrease in Ratings, driven by an exceptionally soft issuance environment. During the first quarter, global bond issuance decreased 12%. This understates the impact to our business, however, as high-yield issuance declined far more dramatically.
In the U.S., issuance in aggregate decreased 25% as investment-grade decreased 19%, high-yield decreased 75%, public finance decreased 15%, structured finance increased 9% due to large increases in mortgage-backed securities, offset by declines in structured credit. Bank loan ratings declined 35% year over year. European issuance decreased 14% as investment-grade decreased 11%, high-yield decreased 54% and structured finance increased 27% due to increases in RMBS and covered bonds, partially offset by declines in ABS, CMBS and structured credit. In Asia, issuance was flat.
The next two slides look at the difference we saw in the quarter between investment-grade issuance and the issuance of high-yield and leveraged loans. This slide shows that investment-grade issuance is resilient relative to other categories, decreasing only 5% year over year. This slide depicts the combination of high-yield issuance and leveraged loan volume. This quarter, we saw a decrease of over 50% from the incredible levels in the year-ago period.
High-yield was particularly impacted by the uncertainty in the market, with issuance decreasing 68% year over year. While difficult to pinpoint exact causes, issuance in the first quarter was impacted, both by the pull-forward we witnessed and discussed last year, as well as the intentional delay we're hearing from customers, as many issuers wait for clearer signs of stability before reentering the market. Now, turning to some of the factors that made this quarter successful for S&P Global. We saw significant increases in engagement and usage of our products and our content this quarter.
The metrics on this slide are clear evidence that in periods of increased uncertainty, whether that's in the macroeconomic picture, market volatility or geopolitical tensions, our customers turn to us. They turn to us for the insights, data and tools that they need to make well-informed business and investment decisions. It's also important to remember that S&P Global's stronger, more diverse product portfolio allows areas of the business to thrive in times of elevated volatility and uncertainty. Within the S&P Dow Jones indices business, we saw more than 20% growth in revenue from our exchange-traded derivatives, whose volumes are directly correlated with market volatility.
Our conferences bring people together to drive innovation and growth in different industries, but they also demonstrate the strength of S&P Global as a source and a destination for global leadership. We're thrilled with the progress we've made as we celebrate the first anniversary of Sustainable1. ESG revenue growth accelerated on both a reported and organic basis in the first quarter, growing 57% year over year to reach nearly $50 million. We continue to introduce new ESG-related products and product enhancements at a rapid pace.
We have updated our bond issuance forecast for the year to reflect the decrease seen in the first quarter, as well as to better reflect the ongoing impact of macroeconomic uncertainty and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. We now expect Global issuance to decline approximately 5% year over year within a range of down 14% to flat in 2022. We expect corporates to see a 12% decrease in issuance, partially offset by a 2% increase in financial services issuance. We expect U.S.
We have suspended commercial operations in Russia and Belarus, including all customer contracts. We've suspended ratings of Russian entities and removed stocks and bonds listed or domiciled in Russia from our indices. While the direct financial impact on our business is not material, we acknowledge the indirect impact on the issuance environment and market volatility. We also wanted to illustrate some of the changes in the macroeconomic environment that inform our financial outlook for the company.
In addition to lower debt issuance, we now expect slightly lower global GDP growth. Inflation is also likely to have a greater impact on our business and economy as a whole relative to our expectations earlier this year. We're seeing some upward pressure on compensation expense that we expect to continue throughout the rest of the year. Commodities prices remain elevated relative to our early expectations as well.
To be clear, this is not meant to be a comprehensive list of all metrics that inform our outlook, but we wanted to help investors understand the changes in some of the assumptions we make about the global economy when formulating guidance. Before handing it over to Ewout, I'd like to reiterate how pleased we are with the execution and success we've seen in a challenging quarter. Our ability to drive positive growth in both revenue and adjusted pro forma earnings per share in a quarter like this would have been much more challenging before our merger with IHS Markit. The strength, stability and scale of our businesses gives us great confidence to invest for future growth and be optimistic about the years ahead.
We remain committed to our strategic organic investments, as illustrated on this slide, and we remain confident these investments will power significant future growth and profitability for the company. With that, I'll turn it over to Ewout to walk through our results and guidance. Ewout?
Thank you, Doug. I want to start by emphasizing the successful execution we saw this quarter. With five of our six divisions posting pro forma revenue growth, it's already clear that we are more resilient, both operationally and financially as a combined company. With our larger scale and more diversified revenue streams, we're more insulated to volatility in the debt issuance market.
As such, we were able to grow pro forma revenue and adjusted EPS year over year even during a period of sharp decreases in issuance. Doug highlighted the headline financial results. I will take a moment to cover a few other items. But as a reminder, when we discuss financial results from operations and cash flows, we're discussing those results on an adjusted pro forma basis as if S&P Global and IHS Markit were combined for the entirety of all periods presented, unless explicitly called out as GAAP.
The decrease in adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to tax deductions related to stock-based compensation and merger-related optimization of capital and liquidity structure. As we introduced last year, we'll continue to disclose these three categories of non-GAAP adjustments to provide insights into the type of expenses that we are incurring related to the merger and the synergies we have discussed. Transaction costs in the quarter were $281 million. These are costs related to completing the merger.
They include legal fees, investment banking fees and filing fees. Integration costs in the quarter were $58 million. These are costs to operationalize the integration. They include consulting, infrastructure and retention cost.
Cost to achieve synergies amounted to $88 million in the quarter. These are costs needed to enable expense and revenue synergies. They include lease terminations, severance, contract exit fees and investments related to product development, marketing and distribution enhancements. During the first quarter, the non-GAAP operating adjustments collectively totaled to $504 million, including a $1.3 billion gain on the sale of businesses and a $200 million contribution to the S&P Global Foundation, in addition to the merger-related items I mentioned.
We also recognized $15 million in additional expense related to the ongoing cloud transition. Free cash flow, excluding certain items, was $701 million in the first three months of 2022. Note that this is meant to reflect the estimated free cash flow of the combined company as if the merger were closed on January 1, 2022. We will provide some additional color on the drivers of our cash balance and our gross debt in the next few slides.
Now, turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong, with ample liquidity. As of the end of the first quarter, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.4 billion and debt of $11.4 billion. Our adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA at the end of the first quarter was 2.57 times.
As you can see, our cash balance declined sequentially to $4.4 billion. The single largest driver in the reduction was the $7 billion in cash paid to fund the first tranche of our 2022 $12 billion accelerated share repurchase program. We also received net proceeds from divestitures of $2.6 billion and net proceeds of $2.3 billion from the issuance of debt. Now, to gross debt.
We issued $5.5 billion of new debt in the first quarter, $3.5 billion of which has been allocated to refinancing existing debt. After the quarter closed, we also made a final debt redemption payment of $600 million, which brought our adjusted gross debt leverage down to 2.47 times. Now, I'd like to provide an update on our synergy progress. In the first quarter, we have achieved $23 million in cost synergies, and our current annualized run rate is $135 million.
The JV contributed $26 million in adjusted operating profit to the company. Because the JV is a 50%-owned joint venture operating independent of the company, we do not include the financial results of OSTTRA in the Market Intelligence division. Looking across Market Intelligence, there was solid growth in each category. And on a pro forma basis, desktop revenue grew 7%, data and advisory solutions revenue grew 12%, enterprise solutions revenue grew 2% and credit and risk solutions revenue grew 8%.
As Doug discussed at length, Ratings faced a challenging issuance environment in the first quarter, with revenue declining 15% year over year. Expenses increased 7%, primarily due to compensation expense and information service costs, partially offset by lower occupancy costs. This resulted in a 25% decrease in segment operating profit and 820 basis points decrease in segment operating profit margin. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased approximately 105 basis points to 62%.
Non-transaction revenue increased 7%, primarily due to growth in fees associated with Surveillance and growth in CRISIL revenue. Transaction revenue decreased 31% on the soft issuance already discussed. This slide depicts Ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributors to the decrease in Ratings revenue were a 21% decrease in corporates and a 12% decrease in structured finance, driven predominantly by structured credit.
Growth in manufacturing was 3% year over year related to the well-publicized supply chain challenges faced by automotive OEMs. Financials and Other increased 12%, driven primarily by strength in our insurance underwriting products. S&P Dow Jones indices delivered strong revenue growth of 14% year over year, primarily due to gains in AUM linked to our indices. During the quarter, expenses increased 9%, largely due to strategic investments, increased compensation and IT costs.
Segment operating profit increased 16%, and the segment operating profit margin increased 130 basis points to 69.3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased approximately 10 basis points to 68%. Every category increased revenue this quarter. Asset-linked fees increased 15%, primarily from AUM-driven gains in ETFs, mutual funds and insurance.
This slide depicts our new GAAP guidance, and this slide depicts our updated 2022 adjusted pro forma guidance. For revenue, we now expect a low single-digit increase year over year, reflecting the issuance environment, partially offset by the strength we are seeing in our non-Ratings businesses. We now expect corporate unallocated expense between $85 million and $95 million, approximately $30 million lower than our previous guidance on lower forecast incentive compensation and professional fees. Interest expense is expected in the range of $360 million to $370 million, down $10 million from prior guidance.
We're focused on the enormous long-term opportunity ahead of us as a combined company, and we are more confident than ever in our ability to execute against that opportunity. Our differentiated data, insights, analytics and services help our customers to thrive and accelerate progress. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Mark for your questions.",14.0,Low
SPGI,2022,2,"Good morning and thank you for joining today's S&P Global second quarter 2022 earnings call. presenting on today's call are Doug Peterson, president and chief executive officer, and Ewout Steenbergen, executive vice president and chief financial officer. We issued a press release with our results earlier today. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com.
The matters discussed in today's conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events. Any such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. A discussion of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our Forms 10-K, 10-Q and other periodic reports filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we're providing adjusted financial information.
This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as management. The earnings release contains exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP. I would also like to call your attention to a European regulation. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&P Global should contact investor relations to better understand the potential impact of this legislation on the investor and the company.
Thank you, Mark. Welcome to today's second quarter earnings call. Our second quarter results demonstrate the combined efforts of our truly incredible team. After our first 100 days as a combined company, it's clear than ever that after the merger, S&P Global is stronger, more resilient, more diversified and better positioned than ever.
Recurring revenue increased 5% year over year, representing 81% of revenue in the quarter. Adjusted expenses only increased 1% as continued investment and inflation pressures on compensation and technology were almost entirely offset by cost synergies in the quarter. We're reinstating our guidance, which reflects the challenging macroeconomic environment, though we will be able to offset some of the EPS impact, as Ewout will discuss in a moment. Importantly, our updated guidance calls for a smaller than 2% decrease in adjusted EPS at the midpoint, illustrating the resilience of the businesses and the positive impact of our capital allocation strategy.
I would also like to share a few other highlights from the second quarter. As I mentioned, we are now more than 100 days past the merger close. Our post-merger integration efforts are proceeding on schedule, but very importantly, we're outperforming on both cost and revenue synergies. Momentum continues on product development with several areas of innovation that we'll highlight for you on today's call.
We're moving fast on our office integration plan and consolidated 10 of our office locations around the world, lowering our real estate costs. We completed our major New York City consolidation and are on track to complete our London consolidation in the fourth quarter. When we announced the merger, we highlighted our expectation that the combined company would be more agile, innovative and entrepreneurial. And we've seen that in initiatives such as the Data Lake Hackathon led by Kensho's head of AI research and teams of data scientists, machine learning engineers and software developers.
These teams spent two days exploring how to best leverage Kensho tools and other technologies to drive value from the Data Lake data sets, and we're thrilled with what these teams have found in just two days. In addition to finding ways that Kensho solutions can add commercial value to unstructured data sets across the Data Lake, we identified new data sets for training Kensho Scribe, NERD, Link and Extract, more than doubling current training data sets in some cases. We also identified data sets to improve S&P Global's country risk assessments and found compelling new ways to classify and improve data for ESG. This hackathon enabled us to better realize the full capabilities of our combined data sets.
There is incredible demand for insights and thought leadership on topics like energy security, climate, technology and digital disruptions, supply chains and capital markets. We have unique data sets and insights in all of these areas, and we see the research council as a way to make sure that our insights are most impactful for our customers and drive innovation within S&P Global. That focus on accelerating innovation was on full display in the second quarter. We launched exciting new products from commodity insights, including a new basin-level methane intensity calculation product for 19 US natural gas production areas.
Our adjusted pro forma operating profit margin decreased approximately 280 basis points to 47% as both profits and margins were negatively impacted by the decrease in ratings transaction revenue and the expense growth I mentioned earlier. Importantly, our non-ratings businesses in aggregate posted strong growth in the quarter, increasing revenue by 7% year over year. As you know, we measure and track adjusted segment operating profit margin on a trailing 12-month basis, which was 46.1% as of the second quarter. Through strong and disciplined execution and prudent capital allocation, we were able to offset much of the earnings impact of the issuance environment, posting fully diluted EPS of $2.81, representing a 7% decrease year over year.
Whether it's tracking market movements, company performance or supply chain constraints, our customers continue to come to us for help navigating uncertain waters. This helped drive 25% growth in aftermarket research in market intelligence. In the second quarter, we celebrated the second anniversary of the S&P Global Marketplace. Customers continue to come to S&P Global as a trusted source for differentiated data around ESG, fundamentals, machine-readable text and workflow tools like our Workbench.
Interestingly, this is the first time that I can recall seeing declines in every category and every region since I've been doing earnings calls. We've included additional details on the subcomponents of issuance by region in the slide deck. Each year, S&P Dow Jones Indices conducts a survey of assets, as depicted in this slide. Asset levels and actively managed funds that benchmark against our indices increased 38% to $12.8 trillion as of the end of 2021.
Assets and passive funds invested in products indexed to our indices increased 32% to $9.9 trillion. Numerous indices support the $9.9 trillion, including the S&P 500, the largest with $7 trillion in assets. We've seen strong growth in factor and sector indices, as well as many of our ESG and climate-related indices. While the S&P 500 still accounts for the majority of AUM, we continued to see strong demand for that historic index among asset managers.
We continue to introduce new ESG-related products and product enhancements at a rapid pace. In the second quarter, we saw the launch of multiple ESG- and sustainability-related ETFs based on our indices. And we ended the second quarter with AUM and ESG ETFs growing 16% year over year to approximately $30 billion. Our indices and commodity insights teams continued their collaboration and launched the S&P Battery Metals Index.
Within ratings, we completed 20 ESG evaluations and 34 sustainable financing opinions driven by strong demand for second-party opinions. Lastly, we hosted the S&P Global Sustainable1 Summit with events in several major cities around the world, bringing together leaders from various stakeholder groups to discuss the future of sustainability. Now, turning to our outlook. Twice a year, we update our global refinancing study.
But given the issuance environment, we wanted to provide a bit more color this quarter. Specifically, there are two impacts to highlight as investors look at total global debt outstanding. The two impacts are average time to maturity and FX rates. When we look at global corporate bond maturities, we see a similar phenomenon to what we have witnessed historically.
Over the next three years, we see a decrease in near-term maturities as refinancing pushed those maturity dates out. We have witnessed this phenomena in the July update each year, so we aren't surprised by it. While total global debt maturing over the next three years is down significantly from six months ago, it's important to note that debt maturing over the next 10 years is not down significantly, and it starts to increase over the next three to five years. We expect 2024 and 2025 refinancing activity to start next year.
This is particularly true for total debt outstanding on an FX-adjusted basis. With the strengthening of the US dollar since January, foreign-denominated debt is lower by 1% when converted to US dollars at July rates. This slide shows total global debt rated by S&P Global of all maturities on a constant currency basis, which increased 2% if measured at January FX rates. While we don't expect a significant rebound in issuance in the back half of this year, this demonstrates that over the long term, the public debt markets remain very healthy and have a strong history of resilience.
They also reinforce our view that the issuance headwinds we're seeing in the market now will likely moderate, if not reverse in the future. Now, for issuance outlook. S&P Global Ratings research has updated its bond issuance forecast for the year to reflect a decrease in the second quarter and more conservative assumptions around the back half. Global market issuance is now expected to decline approximately 16% year over year within a range of down 9% to down 24% in 2022.
This forecast implies an approximate 21% decline in the second half compared to the 11% decline seen in the first half. Non-financials are expected to see a 30% decrease in issuance, partially tempered by a smaller, roughly 10% decrease in financial services issuance. US public finance and structured finance are expected to soften by 12% and 14%, respectively, and international public finance is expected to be roughly flat. As a reminder, the global debt issuance forecast is a product of the S&P Global ratings research team and reflects market issuance, including unrated issuance.
We wanted to take the opportunity to explain the different categories of issuance that we discuss from time to time. The most frequently cited forecast is out of our S&P Global ratings research team, which I just outlined, but our Ratings revenue is more closely tied to S&P billed issuance, which is a subset of market issuance. Billed issuance includes leverage loans which are not included in the market issuance forecast. It does not, however, include debt from unrated categories such as medium-term notes and most domestic debt from China, nor would our billed issuance include international public finance.
While there are other nuances as well, these differences in aggregate bridge the gap between our market issuance forecast and the assumption for billed issuance that underpins our ratings revenue guidance for the year. As Ewout will outline, our ratings revenue guidance assumes a 30% to 45% decrease in billed issuance. Looking beyond issuance, we see a number of secular trends that stand to benefit the company, both this year and beyond. Our experts in commodity insights expect oil prices and volatility to remain above historical norms for some time.
As we noted in June when we suspended guidance, we have seen a deterioration in several economic indicators over the course of the second quarter. We expect slightly lower GDP growth, higher inflation and a lower debt issuance environment to impact not only our businesses, but our customers as well. As Ewout will discuss in a moment, we're seeing inflationary pressure on our costs with approximately 70% of our expenses tied to headcount. That pressure is showing up most in our compensation and technology costs.
As a reminder, this is not meant to be a comprehensive list of all metrics that inform our outlook, but we wanted to help investors understand the changes in some of the assumptions that we make about the global economy when formulating guidance. While we're not discussing 2023 or beyond on today's call, we're pleased to announce an investor day that we expect to hold on December 1 in New York City. We're looking forward to sharing with you some preliminary views on 2023, as well as a more holistic update on our strategy, positioning and medium-term financial targets at that time. Before handing it over to Ewout, I'd like to reiterate how pleased we are with the progress we're making on integration and the clear proof points we see reinforcing the industrial logic of the merger and the resilience of our businesses.
Thank you, Doug. With five of our six divisions once again posting revenue growth, we continue to see evidence that we are a stronger, more resilient company. Doug highlighted the headline financial results. I will take a moment to cover a few other items.
The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to the post-merger change in the mix of income by jurisdiction. As most are aware, we exclude the impact of certain items from our adjusted diluted EPS number. Among those items in the second quarter were $220 million in merger-related expenses, the details of which can be found in the appendix. We generated adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items, of $924 million.
So while we are not changing the expected range for 2022, we're confident that we are more likely to come out at the higher end of the 35% to 40% target range. Now, let's turn to the division results and begin with market intelligence. Market intelligence delivered revenue growth of 7% with growth across all product lines. We want to emphasize the increased resilience and stickiness of most of our revenue and the more diversified portfolio of products in our divisions post-merger.
We expect those volume-driven headwinds to persist through the rest of the year. While we are pleased with the outperformance of credit and risk solutions in the first half, we're lapping some difficult comps in the second half and expect revenue growth to decelerate in that part of the business. Ratings faced continued difficult market conditions this quarter with revenue declining 26% year over year. Expenses decreased 6%, primarily driven by disciplined expense management, including lower incentive expenses, as well as lower occupancy cost and favorable FX, partially offset by increased salary and fringe expenses and T&E spend.
This slide depicts ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributors to the decrease in ratings revenue were a 39% decrease in corporates and a 20% decrease in structured finance, driven predominantly by structured credit. In addition, financial services decreased 9%, governments decreased 15% and the CRISIL and other category increased 14%. And now turning to commodity insights, revenue increased 4%.
Growth in Manufacturing was 3% year over year, driven by demand for supply chain products among suppliers, though growth was tempered by relatively flat original equipment manufacturer or OEM spend on marketing initiatives powered by mobility products. Financials and Other increased 3%, primarily driven by continued strength in our insurance underwriting products, tempered by slowing consumer activity and persistent low volumes across auto sales. S&P Dow Jones Indices delivered another strong quarter of revenue growth of 12% year over year primarily due to gains in ETD volumes. For this quarter, 83% of indices revenues were classified as recurring.
Asset-linked fees were up 5%, primarily from AUM-driven gains in mutual funds and ETFs. Exchange-traded derivatives revenue increased 64% on increased trading volumes across key contracts, including the more than 60% increase in S&P 500 Index options volume. Data and custom subscriptions increased 6% driven by new business activities. Over the past year, ETF AUM net inflows were $231 billion, and market depreciation totaled $352 billion.
This resulted in quarter-ending ETF AUM of $2.5 trillion, which is a 5% decrease compared to one year ago. Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM, which increased 5% year over year. Revenue tends to lack changes in asset prices, which helped drive outperformance this quarter. However, we expect asset-linked fees to decrease in the back half of this year.
Sequentially versus the end of the first quarter, ETF net inflows associated with our indices totaled $6 billion, and market depreciation totaled $436 billion. Within our Engineering Solutions division, we saw 3% revenue growth, driven primarily by growth in non-subscription offerings, most notably the Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, or BPVC, which was last released in August of 2021. For this quarter, 93% of engineering solutions revenues were classified as recurring. Adjusted expenses increased 5% driven by investment in product development and increased royalties.
This drives our expectation for adjusted operating margins between 45.3% and 45.8%. As declines in high-margin ratings revenue disproportionally impacts margins to the downside this year, we wanted to emphasize the margin expansion we expect to see elsewhere in the business. In aggregate, within our five non-ratings divisions, we expect approximately 180 basis points of operating margin expansion this year. Interest expense is expected in the range of $360 million to $370 million, in line with our most recent guidance.
For ratings, we now expect revenue declines in the low to mid-20s range and margins in the mid- to high 50s. For commodity insights, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range and margins in the mid-40s. For mobility, we expect revenue growth in the high single-digit range and margins in the high 30s. For indices, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digit range and margins in the mid- to high-60s.
For Engineering Solutions, we expect low single-digit revenue growth and margins in the mid-teens. In closing, this quarter provides further proof of the resilience of our business. Our ability to outperform on synergies speaks volumes on the focus and discipline of the teams we have at S&P Global. Those teams, combined with a phenomenal set of truly differentiated products and capabilities, position us well to drive profitable growth in the years to come.",14.0,Low
SPGI,2022,3,"Good morning and thank you for joining today's S&P Global third quarter 2022 earnings call. Presenting on today's call are Doug Peterson, president and chief executive officer, and Ewout Steenbergen, executive vice president and chief financial officer. We issued a press release with our results earlier today. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com.
The matters discussed in today's conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events. Any such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. A discussion of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our Forms 10-K, 10-Q and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
I would also like to call your attention to a specific European regulation. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&P Global should contact investor relations to better understand the potential impact of this legislation on the investor and the company. We are aware that we have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to our Media Relations team, whose contact information can be found in the press release.
Thank you, Mark. We're pleased to discuss our third quarter results and how we're growing, innovating and executing with discipline even in the face of a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. With each quarter that passes, we see further evidence of the strength of our combined company. While no one could have predicted what this year would have looked like, we have benefited from the diversification of our revenue and profit streams and that ballast has provided great resilience as we continue to navigate choppy waters.
Our post-merger integration efforts are proceeding on track, but very importantly, we're outperforming on both cost and revenue synergies. Our customer conversations remain encouraging despite the economic environment. We continue to see significant growth in multiple business lines due to secular trends that will likely benefit us for years to come, like energy transition, as well as the near-term benefit we see from volatility and the need for insights and analytics in times of turbulence. We also remain committed to the capital allocation plan we laid out for you at the time the merger closed.
Between market intelligence and commodity insights, we've generated well over 3,000 cross-sell referrals since the merger closed, and the conversion rates are strong. Despite the issuance environment, our ratings teams remain highly engaged. We remain connected with investors and issuers to maintain relationships and ensure we have the appropriate understanding of their needs in advance of any recovery in the debt markets. Commodity insights and mobility are both seeing significantly improved retention rates relative to recent history, as well as strong competitive wins and new customer growth.
We saw a very important win in our indices business this quarter as a large Japanese asset manager launched the first cross-asset ETF in Japan based on both iBoxx Fixed Income and S&P Dow Jones Equity Indices. While it's still early in our efforts in cross-asset indices, this launch is powerful proof of the demand for such products among global asset managers. Now, to recap the financial results for the third quarter. Revenue decreased 8% to $2.86 billion or 6% constant currency.
Our adjusted operating profit decreased 12% to $1.3 billion. Our adjusted pro forma operating profit margin decreased approximately 200 basis points to 46% as both profits and margin were negatively impacted by the decrease in ratings transaction revenue, partially offset by cost synergies realized in the quarter. Our non-ratings businesses in aggregate grew revenue 4% in the quarter compared to prior year. As you know, we measure and track adjusted segment operating profit margin on a trailing 12-month basis, which was 45.5% as of the third quarter.
Despite the impact of the issuance environment, we benefited from the resiliency of our businesses, as well as disciplined cost management and cost synergies to significantly moderate the impact to our adjusted EPS, which declined only 4% year over year. Looking across the six divisions. I'm pleased to report positive growth across four of our divisions, with ratings continuing to work through a difficult issuance cycle and engineering solutions entering an off-cycle quarter without the sale of a core product that is released once every two years. Throughout the year, we've seen outsized growth in certain products as customers depend on our data and information to make informed decisions during uncertain times.
We saw double-digit revenue growth in multiple product lines as a result. Within our indices business, revenue from exchange-traded derivatives outperformed our internal expectations, growing nearly 40% year over year. Our CDS Indices, which include the CDX and iTraxx Index families increased 66%. Markets continue to recognize our leadership in areas like climate and financial data, and we provide a consolidated platform on which to access information.
Within market intelligence, we launched enhanced physical risk exposure scores and financial impact data sets to support clients as they seek to understand and manage the physical and financial exposure to climate change. Our ratings division continues to see success here as well, completing 13 ESG evaluations and 23 sustainable financing opinions in the quarter. One of the most important competitive advantages in our ESG efforts is the Corporate Sustainability Assessment, which is an annual comprehensive assessment completed in partnership with participating companies. The S&P Global brand and everything it stands for continues to drive growth in the number of companies seeking to partner with us in this assessment process.
Year-to-date, we've seen more than 2,300 companies opt in, a more than 25% increase from the same time last year. Now, turning to the outlook for the remainder of the year. Beginning with our issuance forecast. Our ratings Research team is expecting an approximately 19% decline in global market issuance, including both rated and unrated issuance for the full year.
When we look to the broader macroeconomic environment for the rest of 2022, we continue to see further deterioration from what we expected in August. In addition to the downward trend in issuance, our expectations for GDP growth, inflation and the commodities markets have all lowered. With only two months left in 2022, we wanted to provide what will likely be the final update on some of the macroeconomic indicators we're using to help inform our financial guidance for the year. We'll not be discussing our expectations for 2023 on this call, but we will be closely monitoring both the internal and external indicators of our business over the coming months.
And we'll plan to provide our initial 2023 outlook at the customary time when we report our fourth quarter results early next year. Before I turn the call over to Ewout, I want to thank the incredible people we have at S&P Global. Our people have executed well in a challenging environment this year and have delivered great value for our customers and the organization while managing a complex integration. I'm confident that we're well-positioned to drive long-term growth and create long-term value for our shareholders.
Adjusted corporate unallocated expenses improved from a year ago, driven by a combination of synergies and reduced incentive cost. Our net interest expense decreased 17% as we benefit from lower average rates due to refinancings following the merger. Adjusted effective tax rate was up modestly, but toward the low end of the guidance range we expect for the full year. As most are aware, we exclude the impact of certain items from our adjusted diluted EPS number.
dollars, which provides some protection to revenue against FX volatility. In addition to the natural hedges that exist due to the global footprint of our people, we have a hedging program in place that further mitigates the ultimate impact on our earnings. For the third quarter, we saw a $0.03 favorable impact to EPS from foreign exchange and hedging programs. Turning to expenses.
Now, looking at ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributors to the decrease in ratings revenue were a 44% decrease in corporates and a 31% decrease in structured finance, driven predominantly by structured credit. In addition, financial services decreased 20%, Governments decreased 33%, and the CRISIL and other category increased 9%. And now turning to commodity insights.
On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 40%. Dealer revenue increased 10% year over year, driven by strong demand for CARFAX as dealerships' profitability remain at elevated levels. Manufacturing grew 4% year over year, driven by strength in subscriptions and an uptick in the Recall business. Inventory shortfalls continue to temper growth as OEMs spend on marketing initiatives powered by mobility products remains muted.
Segment operating profit increased 5%, and the segment operating profit margin increased 100 basis points to 70.3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 68.8%. Asset-linked fees were down 5%, primarily driven by lower AUM in ETFs. Exchange-rated derivative revenue increased 37% on increased trading volumes across key contracts, including a more than 60% increase in S&P 500 Index Options volume.
Data and custom subscriptions increased 10%, driven by new business activities. Over the past year, market depreciation totaled $472 billion. ETF AUM net inflows were $194 billion. This resulted in quarter-ending ETF AUM of $2.3 trillion, which is an 11% decrease compared to one year ago.
Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM, which decreased 4% year over year. As a reminder, revenue tends to lag changes in asset prices. Given the declines across equity markets so far in the back half of this year, we continue to expect softness in asset-linked fees as we close out 2022. engineering solutions revenue declined 8% in the quarter, driven primarily by the negative impact of the timing of the Boiler Pressure Vessel Code, or BPVC, which was last released in August of 2021.
Based on this past quarter's performance, we're updating our expectations for adjusted revenue growth and adjusted operating profit margin for ratings and indices. The guidance ranges for our other divisions are unchanged. In closing, despite the geopolitical tensions and a challenging macroeconomic environment weighing on the market, our portfolio of strong businesses continue to prove resilient. Furthermore, I'm pleased with the progress our teams have made since the closing of the merger earlier this year.
We look forward to providing you with a deep dive into our businesses and the longer-term outlook of the company at our investor day on December 1. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Mark for your questions.",14.0,Low
SRE,2022,1,"Thank you, Glen, and thank you all for joining us today. Against the backdrop of a challenging economic environment, our company remains focused on executing our T&D investment strategy in our core markets. Sempra California is preparing to submit GRC filings at both SDG&E and SoCalGas later this month, focused on providing safe, reliable and cleaner energy to its 26 million consumers. Turning to Texas, Oncor is executing on its record five-year capital plan focused on critical T&D infrastructure investments across its service territory to support strong demographic growth and plans to file its rate case later this month.
And at Sempra Infrastructure, they're developing a platform that's uniquely positioned to export LNG directly from the Gulf and Pacific Coast to customers in Europe and Asia. The recent tragic events unfolding in Ukraine have highlighted the need for secure access to reliable sources of cleaner energy and Sempra Infrastructure is well positioned to be part of the solution. Our strategy of investing in T&D infrastructure to expand and modernize North America's energy systems across each of our three growth platforms is continuing to drive our record $36 billion five-year capital plan and has helped us deliver another quarter of strong financial results. Also in April, we completed $250 million of share repurchases under our existing board authorization.
Please turn to the next slide. I'd now like to briefly highlight some of the key strategic advantages of our T&D portfolio. Sempra's three growth platforms are strategically positioned in highly attractive and contiguous markets in North America and serve one of the largest utility consumer bases in the United States. Our strong position helps create momentum for critical investments in advancing safety, reliability and cleaner energy as the global energy market continues to evolve.
Thanks, Jeff. I'm pleased to share that we recently issued our annual Corporate Sustainability Report for the 14th consecutive year. Sustainability is central to our strategy, capital allocation and sustained performance. Throughout our report, you'll see examples of our sustainable business practices, including how we've aligned our portfolio with long-term macroeconomic market and policy trends.
Among other factors, our corporate strategy is focused on enhancing safety, climate resilience and affordability and capturing new investments in infrastructure that support increasingly diversified and cleaner forms of energy. One of the key improvements to the report is our enhanced ESG reporting to address the evolving needs of our stakeholders in light of a constantly changing environment. We appreciate the collaboration and continue to align our reporting to track and deliver on key ESG metrics. A couple of other highlights from the report are reflected on this slide.
Recently, SDG&E issued its decarbonization road map for California, the path to net zero, which demonstrates our position as a leader in helping the state reach its goal of carbon neutrality by 2045. It's also important to note that safety is foundational to our business. We're continuing the essential work of helping ensure employee and contractor safety and operational excellence. For example, ECA LNG recently surpassed one million hours worked without a lost time injury.
Our strength in sustainable business practices has been recognized by experts in the sector, including the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. And we've been named to the list for four consecutive years. Notably, we are the only North American utility company to be so recognized. I'm very proud of the collective effort from each of our businesses and our shared work with all our stakeholders.
With sustainability at the heart of our corporate strategy, it provides a clear sense of purpose for our 20,000 employees. Please turn to the next slide, where I'll hand the call over to Trevor to provide business and financial updates.
This decision reaffirms the role of renewable natural gas in the state, and we view it as a significant step toward the future of cleaner fuels in California. Against that backdrop, SoCalGas continues to execute on its own goal of 20% renewable natural gas delivery to its core customers by 2030. In April, both SDG&E and SoCalGas filed their cost of capital applications to update each of their authorized rates of return, which would be effective for 2023 through 2025. We expect a decision by year-end.
We look forward to working with the commission and all of our stakeholders on these important regulatory proceedings. Shifting to Texas. It's important to note that in 2021, it was a record year for Oncor in terms of the new and active requests for transmission interconnections, highlighting the rapid economic growth in its service territory. This growth has continued in the first quarter of 2022, with a 78% increase in new interconnection requests compared to the first quarter of 2021.
Oncor's service territory continues to experience strong new commercial development and population increases as demonstrated by Oncor connecting approximately 16,000 new premises in the first quarter. Additionally, last month, Oncor's board of directors approved an update to its 2022 capital plan from $2.8 billion to $3 billion. While Oncor's board typically approves the annual capital plan in October, this off-cycle approval is another example of the robust economic growth in Texas, driving investments to support transmission and distribution expansion. Also in March, Oncor received approval of its transmission cost of service filing for the recovery of its 2021 capital investments.
As part of our effort to develop Cameron LNG Phase II, we've successfully reached a number of important commercial and permitting milestones and are now progressing toward the engineering stage of the project. As a reminder, in January, we filed our amendment with the FERC to transition from gas turbines to electric drives. If approved, this would result in a more capital-efficient single train with an estimated 44% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the previous design. Also, last month, we signed project development agreements and an HOA with Cameron LNG partners to advance Phase 2 of the project.
These arrangements provide the commercial framework for the development of a fourth train as well as increased production capacity through debottlenecking activities from the existing three trains. Sempra Infrastructure contemplates taking its share of the offtake and selling it under long-term sale and purchase agreements to third parties. In summary, under the proposed arrangement, Cameron LNG Phase 2 would be fully contracted prior to reaching a final investment decision. In addition, we selected two FEED contractors to run a competitive process, which is intended to culminate in a fixed-price turnkey EPC contract.
To summarize. We've continued to invest in our record capital plan to help build the energy networks of the future. We're pleased about the strength of our financial performance this quarter, and we'll remain highly focused on executing our strategy and capital program throughout the remainder of the year. With that, this concludes our prepared remarks.",25.0,
SRE,2022,2,"Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. We also encourage you to review our 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30th, 2022. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only of today, August 4th, 2022. And it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.
Thank you, Glenn, and thank you all for joining us today. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $1.98 and year-to-date 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $4.90. Based on the strength of these results, we're now guiding to the high end of our full year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance range, and we're also affirming our full year 2023 EPS guidance range. Next let me offer some perspectives on how we think about the future.
At Sempra, we've worked hard to simplify our business model, to improve safety and operations, and with the benefit of more disciplined capital allocation to also improve our financial performance. Today, we have built three large-scale growth platforms operating in some of the largest energy markets in North America. Within these platforms, we have an exciting opportunity set. Here's a quick summary.
In the first half of this year, the United States became the No. 1 global exporter of LNG. And by the end of the decade, we expect the United States will extend its significant leadership advantage in this area. In combination, these investment opportunities support our record $36 billion capital plan for 2022 through 2026 as well as our continued confidence in our projected 6% to 8% annual average long-term EPS growth rate, which we announced earlier this year.
In April, both SDG&E and SoCalGas filed their cost of capital applications to update their respective authorized rates of return for 2023 through 2025, and we expect a final decision by year-end. To further support grid resiliency, the CPUC approved SDG&E's four new microgrid facilities. These new energy storage projects are expected to improve power continuity during grid outages and are great examples of the critical investments SDG&E is making to integrate renewables while enhancing reliability for its customers. Additionally, SoCal Gas recently announced that since 2015, it achieved a 37% reduction of fugitive methane emissions significantly ahead of the state's goal of a 20% reduction by 2025 and nearing the state's goal of a 40% reduction by 2030.
This achievement is significant and demonstrates SoCalGas' focus on helping to accelerate the decarbonization of California's energy systems. Shifting to Sempra Texas. Oncor continues to benefit from its demographic growth and strong economic expansion across its service territory. As a result, Oncor has added another 35,000 new premises so far this year.
In May, Oncor filed its rate case with the Public Utility Commission of Texas, requesting a 4.5% revenue requirement increase over current adjusted rates to support Texas' rapid growth trends and need for continued reliability. The new rate is expected to go into effect in the first quarter of 2023. Oncor looks forward to working in partnership with its stakeholders to achieve a positive outcome. Now I'll turn the call over to Justin to discuss updates at Sempra Infrastructure, where we've successfully reached a number of important commercial milestones this quarter.
As we outlined in our last quarterly earnings call, the key work streams that Cameron LNG Phase 2 include completion of our pending FERC amendment, the competitive feed process, and ongoing marketing. With regard to our recently announced commercial arrangements at Cameron, we have worked hard to align our economic and commercial interests with those of our customers. You will recall that we plan to take our 50% share of the Train 4 offtake and sell it back to back to global counterparties under long-term sale and purchase agreements. We are pleased to confirm that we have substantially achieved this marketing goal as a result of the HOAs with the Polish oil and gas company and Ineos, which include the optionality to move volumes between Cameron LNG Phase 2 and Port Arthur LNG.
1 global exporter of LNG. Based on the quality of our development sites and their geographic positioning relative to Europe and Asia, we believe our business can help advance America's leadership position in this area while also providing energy security to our allies and helping facilitate the global energy transition. Please turn to the next slide, where I'll turn the call back to Trevor to discuss Sempra's financial results.
Thanks, Justin. Turning to Sempra's financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $559 million or $1.77 per share. This compares to second quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $424 million or $1.37 per share.
Please turn to the next slide. The variance in the second quarter 2022 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year can be summarized by the following: $48 million of higher equity earnings at Sempra Texas Utilities, primarily due to customer and consumption growth and increase in invested capital; $41 million of higher CPUC base operating margin net of operating expenses at SDG&E and SoCalGas, as well as higher FERC margin at SDG&E and $33 million of higher earnings at Sempra Infrastructure. There are a number of items driving this variance, so please refer to the appendix for further detail. Please turn to the next slide.
As we close our prepared remarks, let me give you a couple of key takeaways. First, comparing the financial results from the first half of this year to the same period in 2021, we posted adjusted earnings growth of 10% and adjusted EPS growth of 7%. It's equally important to note that we have accomplished these results even with the sale of a 30% minority interest in Sempra infrastructure. Second, the steps we've taken to diversify and strengthen SI's capital structure came at an opportune time and have put us in an improved position to execute on a new set of exciting development opportunities, particularly in the LNG space.
Third, going forward, we remain highly focused on safety and operational excellence by executing on our strategy, which includes progressing toward constructive GRC outcomes at Sempra California, extending and improving electric grid resiliency in Texas, while Oncor works with its stakeholders to finalize a constructive base rate case for its customers, and achieving further milestones in our overall development pipeline at Sempra Infrastructure. And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks. So I will now stop and we can open the line to take your questions.",25.0,
STX,2022,1,"Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to [Technical Issues] During today's call, we will refer to GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP figures are reconciled to GAAP figures in the earnings press release posted on our website and included in our Form 8-K that was filed with the SEC. We've not reconciled certain non-GAAP outlook measures, because material items that may impact these measures are out of our control or cannot be reasonably predicted. Therefore a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable efforts.
I've been very proud of our team's ability to post consistent financial results through an industry environment that remains very dynamic. We are seeing a confluence of factors creating inflationary pressures and acute supply chain disruption. These include semiconductor component shortages and freight logistics challenges that are creating cost pressures and impacting critical end product assemblies for certain customers. Notwithstanding these obstacles, underlying demand remained solid for Seagate's products, particularly in the mass capacity market, which is why we maintain a high level of confidence in our fiscal year growth outlook.
In the enterprise and OEM markets, we achieved a fourth consecutive quarter of sales growth, supported by increasing IT hardware spending. Over the near term, the broader supply constraints that are highlighted may delay some of our customers' new product builds due to non-HDD shortages. However, based on customer conversations, we believe any pause will be temporary until shortages are alleviated. Demand for video and image applications increased significantly during the quarter, supported in part by a broadening in use cases that extend beyond traditional security and surveillance applications. The combination of high-definition cameras and data analytics enabling productivity gains, cost savings and revenue generation opportunities are actually driving adoption by a wide range of industries, including retail, manufacturing and healthcare.
We began ramping 20 terabyte products in the September quarter and I'm thrilled with the strong customer interest. I'm equally excited by customer reception for our MACH.2 dual actuator drives, which are now shipping at large scale. As we were anticipating a few months ago, we are seeing greater adoption of our MACH.2 drives for core and edge applications that benefits from the recent [Phonetic] right performance gains that we deliver with these products. We expect dual actuator to become more mainstream as capacities increase beyond 30 terabytes, this for both cost and performance requirements. I'm also confident in achieving 30 terabyte capacities and beyond.
Wrapping up, Seagate continues to deliver consistent financial results, underpinned by strong operational discipline, focus on profitability and growing demand for mass capacity storage. We believe these trends reflect a healthy structural changes that have taken place in the industry in recent years. Seagate is poised to benefit with our technology leadership position and strong track record of execution.
We grew total hard disk drive revenue to $2.9 billion, up 5% sequentially and 34% year-over-year. HDD capacity shipments increased 4% sequentially to 159% exabyte, up 39% relative to the prior year period. Growth was driven by increasing demand for our mass capacity product, which contributed 71% of total HDD revenue and 83% of HDD exabyte shipments. Revenue from the mass capacity markets increased to $2 billion, supported by growth across each of the underlying end market, which include Nearline, VIA and NAS products. Mass capacity revenue was up 8% sequentially and 51% compared with the prior year period, while capacity shipments into this market were up 7% sequentially and 53% year-over-year.
Robust demand in the VIA market led to sequential revenue growth that was above the average for the mass capacity market and we expect solid demand to continue in the December quarter. The legacy market made up the remaining 29% of HDD revenue, holding relatively stable at $831 million, down 3% sequentially and up 5% year-over-year, improving enterprise demand, boosted sales for mission critical drive, which partially offset in decline in consumer drives, following a strong June quarter. We're starting to see a moderation in the face of our revenue decline following the significant market disruption brought down by the pandemic. While we could see some fluctuation in a given quarter, we believe the most pronounced impact are behind us.
Finally, turning to our non-HDD business. Revenue came in at $251 million, down 9% sequentially of June quarter level. Our system business has been partially impacted by some of the supply constraints that Dave discussed. We're working closely with our suppliers to mitigate risk and we continue to gain new customer wins for longer-term growth in the business. Overall, strong demand trend combined with positive industry dynamics led to a non-GAAP gross profit over than $956 million in the September quarter, up 8% sequentially and 57% year-over-year. Cost relating to freight and logistics are continuing to increment high. While we will continue to take steps to reduce the impact of these costs, we believe that we remain a headwind to the business through the fiscal year.
Non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 20.1%, which is the top end of our long-term target range of 15% to 20% of revenue. Importantly, the September performance demonstrated our ability to grow profits faster than revenue, supporting our strategy of long-term value creation. Based on the little share count of approximately 221 million share, non-GAAP EPS for the September quarter was $2.35, the highest level in close to a decade. Where inventory relatively said, we have days inventory outstanding at 50 days. We are working with suppliers and managing strategic inventory levels for meeting entities for the business, while we continue to monitor this dynamic situation.
We used $153 million to fund the quarterly dividend and $425 million to repurchase 4.9 million ordinary shares, exiting the quarter with 225 million shares outstanding and approximately $3.8 billion remaining in our authorization. As Dave mentioned earlier, the Board approved a $0.03 increase to our quarterly dividend, raising the quarterly payout to $0.70 per share. We ended the September quarter with cash and cash equivalents of nearly $1 billion dollar and total liquidity was approximately $2.7 billion, including our revolving any facility. Adjusted EBITDA was $724 million for the quarter and $2.4 billion for the 12-month period ending in September. Total debt balance at the end of the quarter was $5.1 billion with a leverage ratio of 2.2 times.
Thanks, Gianluca. Fiscal 2022 is off to a tremendous start and I feel positive about the current healthy demand environment which is reflected in our increased revenue growth outlook for the fiscal year. I'm equally bullish on Seagate's longer-term growth opportunities supported by secular demand for mass capacity storage. Our mass capacity innovation roadmap put Seagate an excellent position to thrive in this environment and continue to deliver revenue growth beyond fiscal 2022, in line with our long-term target of 3% to 6%. We are in the right place with the right technology and innovative customers with whom we are partnering closely to enable their roadmaps. Further, our robust capital returns program including today's dividend increase round out what we believe is a compelling investment story.
With the UN Climate Change Conference scheduled to begin in less than two weeks, I wanted to highlight Seagate's commitment to ESG. Starting in fiscal 2022, we have incorporated sustainability into our executives long-term compensation plan based on the achievement of specific quantitative, environmental and social targets. Our environmental goal is linked with established plans to reduce the company's carbon footprint in support of achieving our science-based targets, from harnessing renewables at our California and Northern Ireland campuses, to installing solar capacity in our facilities and Thailand, Seagate continues to put our commitment to the planet into action. We have also incorporated an executive compensation goal to increase gender diversity in our leadership as we strive to cultivate a more diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace.",11.0,Low
STX,2022,2,"During today's call, we'll refer to GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP figures are reconciled to GAAP figures in the earnings press release posted on our website and included in our Form 8-K that was filed with the SEC. We've not reconciled certain non-GAAP outlook measures because material items that may impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Therefore, a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable efforts.
This performance is all the more impressive in light of the supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures we are experiencing today and further demonstrates the consistent execution, operational agility and sharp focus on expense discipline that we have displayed throughout the year. To that point, in calendar year 2021, we achieved revenue of nearly $12 billion, up 18% compared with the prior calendar year. We expanded non-GAAP EPS by more than 75%, and we grew free cash flow by nearly 40%, truly an outstanding year of growth that shows we are capitalizing on the secular tailwinds driving long-term mass capacity storage demand. As we shared many times before, driving profitability and free cash flow generation remain two of Seagate's top priority and underpin our focus on enhancing value for our customers and shareholders.
Our execution and product momentum position Seagate to deliver a third consecutive calendar year of top-line growth. We currently expect calendar year '22 revenue to increase 3% to 6% with further growth beyond, consistent with our long-term model range. Let me spend a few minutes discussing the current business environment. In the December quarter, we again generated record mass capacity revenue with growth led by demand from cloud customers.
We have previously shared how emerging use cases at the edge are driving meaningful opportunities within the VIA market. These applications utilize high-definition video and AI analytics to capture and extract data value. In the December quarter, sales of our VIA products remain healthy, and we expect the March quarter to be seasonally slower, consistent with historical trends. Longer term, we continue to forecast exabyte growth in the mid-teens, supported by expanding opportunities at the edge.
Moving to our other markets. Sequential growth from the cloud in the December quarter was somewhat counterbalanced by lower revenue in the enterprise, OEM and legacy PC markets that we attribute primarily to the COVID-related supply challenges that dominated broader industry headlines. As we indicated last quarter, non-HDD component shortages are disrupting some of our enterprise and OEM customer shipment plans, which impact both mass capacity near-line and legacy mission-critical drives. We are mindful that these supply pressures and other COVID-related measures could further weigh on the typical March quarter seasonality that we anticipate in the VIA and legacy markets.
However, customers are managing through the tight supply environment and expect conditions to ease over the next couple of quarters. Seasonality and temporary constraints aside, the long-term mass capacity demand trends remain strong. In this environment, we remain focused on exercising capital discipline to align supply with demand and continue to engage with customers on their longer-term demand requirements to ensure that our production capacity plans align with their future ramp time lines. With lead times for high-capacity HDDs of six months or longer, an increasing portion of our near-line drive revenue is under long-term agreements with momentum to expand even further.
As a result, we are using the seasonal slowdown in the March quarter to stage our factory operations to support strong 20-terabyte demand as the year unfolds. Our common platform approach helps to facilitate this process by enabling us to quickly transition and ramp new products into the market. Our 20-terabyte drives highly leverage the head and media technology that power our 18-terabyte product family, making the production process well understood and haste in time to yield. This strategy also provides manufacturing flexibility and improves our overall cost efficiencies across the breadth of our common platform family, which currently spans 16 through 20 terabyte capacities for CMR products with some customers stretching to 22 terabytes using SMR feature sets.
In our HDD drive business, we achieved the fifth consecutive quarter of record capacity shipments, totaling 163 exabytes, up 3% sequentially and up 26% year on year. Ongoing cloud demand for our near-line products supported mass capacity revenue of $2 billion, up 1% sequentially and up 25% compared with the prior-year period. Shipments into the mass capacity market totaled 137 exabytes, up 4% sequentially and 41% year over year. Near-line remains our fastest growing product segment with revenue outpacing the broader mass capacity business.
In the December quarter, we increased shipment to 111 exabytes, up 4% sequentially and 56% year on year, supported by the ongoing cloud adoption of 18-terabyte drives, as well as healthy demand for mid-capacity products from enterprise and OEM customers. Our 20-terabyte product family is growing strong customer interest, and we are continuing to scale 18 terabyte shipments while also preparing for an anticipated steep 20-terabyte ramp in the coming quarters to support demand. Sales into the VIA markets remained healthy in the December quarter, following two quarters of rapid growth and near record revenue in September. We project a seasonal slowdown in the VIA market during the March quarter, but expect revenue to remain up on a year-over-year basis.
While we continue to face near-term supply challenges for both the system and SSD businesses, we remain confident in growing the non-HDD business in fiscal 2022, particularly for our system solution, where we see ongoing demand and continue to capture new customer logos. Looking at our operational performance. Non-GAAP gross profit in the December quarter was $958 million. Our corresponding non-GAAP gross margin was 30.7%, down 30 basis points sequentially, but up nearly 400 basis points year over year.
The ongoing transition to both higher capacity drives and cost-optimized products mostly offset higher freight and logistic costs and the less favorable product mix with a record non-HDD sales. Notably, HDD gross margin remain in the upper half of our long-term target range of 30% to 33%, flat with the prior quarter. We maintained relatively flat non-GAAP operating expenses at $337 million, lower than expected, reflecting our disciplined expense management and the timing of certain spending. We expect opex to be somewhat higher in the March quarter due to an increased R&D expenses and business travel.
Our resulting non-GAAP operating income was $621 million, down 1% sequentially and up 61% year on year. Non-GAAP operating margin remained relatively flat with the prior quarter at 19.9% and at the top end of our long-term target range of 15% to 20% of revenue. Based on diluted share count of approximately 225 million shares, non-GAAP EPS for the December quarter was $2.41, which is $0.06 above our guidance midpoint. We increased inventory by approximately $100 million with days inventory outstanding of 54 days to support the upcoming 20-terabyte product trend.
In the December quarter, we used $151 million for the quarterly dividend and $471 million to repurchase 5.1 million ordinary shares, exiting the quarter with 219 million shares outstanding and approximately $3.3 billion remaining in our authorization. We ended the December quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 billion. And total liquidity was approximately $3.3 billion, including our revolving credit facility. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $723 million in the quarter, our highest level in seven years, and was $2.6 billion for the 12-month period ending in December.
Total debt balance at the end of the quarter was $5.9 billion, and as we previously reported, we plan to repay $120 million in debt coming due in March. In summary, we delivered solid financial performance, maintaining our focus on driving profitability and free cash flow generation while navigating a dynamic business environment. Looking ahead to the March quarter, we expect a continuation of the healthy demand environment in the near-line market with anticipated seasonal decline in VIA and the legacy markets. As Dave noted, we are mindful of the ongoing impact related to corporate dynamics and will continue to manage through supply chain constraints and other inflationary pressures that we expect to persist through at least the fiscal year.
These innovations are the result of years of intense focus and significant investments that bring value to our customers and to their customers by unlocking the power of their data. We are focused on capturing an appropriate return to continue fueling our mass capacity innovation engine, which we believe is healthy for Seagate and for the industry at large. In closing, I would like to thank our employees who deserve the credit for Seagate's outstanding performance this past year. We are a values-driven company, and last week, we published our third annual diversity, equity and inclusion report that captures the many ways we put our value of inclusion into action.
Among the many positive measures in the report, I want to highlight an increase in the overall percentage of women in director and executive roles, as well as an increase in minorities in our U.S. workforce. These are important areas of focus for the company and reflects positive progress in our efforts to build a more global, diverse and inclusive workforce, which we believe leads to better business sustainability. I would also like to thank our customers and suppliers for their continued support and our shareholders for their trust in Seagate.",11.0,Low
STX,2022,3,"During today's call, we'll refer to GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP figures are reconciled to GAAP figures in the earnings press release posted on our website and included in our Form 8-K that was filed with the SEC. We've not reconciled certain non-GAAP outlook measures because material items that may impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Therefore, a reconciliation of the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.
These achievements reflect the resiliency of our financial model and our focus on driving profitability and cash generation in an environment where we are poised to capitalize on strong secular growth for mass capacity storage. While the underlying storage demand trends remain intact, the industrywide supply challenges impacts from the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and COVID restrictions are constraining growth over the near term, which we factored into the June quarter guidance we're providing today. Throughout the past couple of years, our strong supplier relationships, combined with our vertically integrated business model, have enabled us to navigate supply risks to support HDD customer demand. All the while, we've remained highly focused on protecting profitability.
In addition to maintaining strong expense discipline, we have recently started to adjust pricing to help combat inflationary impacts in future quarters. Finally, we continue to strategically manage production and execute our product and technology road map. These actions are intended to reduce our cost per terabyte and realize operational efficiencies while delivering cost-efficient, higher-capacity solutions to our customers when they need them most. As we indicated on our last call, we leveraged the seasonal slowdown in the March quarter to begin staging our factories to support strong 20-terabyte demand.
I'm delighted to report that we are shipping 20-plus terabyte products in high volume and expect unit shipments to more than triple quarter over quarter in F Q4 to well over 1 million units. This puts us on a pace for the company to achieve crossover with 18-terabyte drives early in the new fiscal year. The ability to quickly ramp and yield higher capacity products is especially important considering the strong cloud data center demand for nearline drives. Recent CIO surveys confirm that even in today's challenging macro environment, digital transformation, AI, and machine learning remain among the top handful of IT investment priorities.
With current non-HDD supply shortages impacting new data center build-outs, many of our cloud customers, particularly in the U.S., are operating at or near record utilization levels, and upgrading to higher capacity drives in an effort to keep pace with demand. Seagate is addressing these needs by being the first to high volume with the 20-plus terabyte products, which represents the highest capacity drives commercially available today. With more than half of our cloud business currently covered under long-term agreements, we have visibility to healthy cloud demand into the back half of the calendar year. In the March quarter, mass capacity revenue increased 18% year over year and decreased 6% sequentially off a record December quarter.
Strong double-digit sequential growth in cloud nearline sales partially offset the impacts of demand constraints in the other mass capacity end markets. In the enterprise and OEM market, some customers continue to grapple with non-HDD supply shortages that have impacted their ability to get parts and address their own in demand. COVID lockdown measures are limiting near-term demand in the VIA markets. In the March quarter, new security surveillance and smart city infrastructure projects were delayed due in large part to physical installations being hindered.
We look forward to sharing more in the year ahead. Looking ahead, Seagate remains well-positioned to achieve our long-term financial and business goals. We are focused on driving profitability toward the upper half of our long-term margin ranges over the next few quarters. At the same time, we expect to extend our track record of strong cash flow generation while executing our product and technology road map that collectively puts us on the right path to capture mass capacity storage opportunities and enhance value for all of our key stakeholders.
Non-GAAP EPS was $1.81, up 22% year over year. The hard disk business ship approximately 154 exabytes, down 6% sequentially and up 10% year-on-year. Strong demand for high-capacity nearline drives boosted average capacity per total HDD drive to a record 6.7 terabyte, up 10% sequentially and 32% year on year. Demand for our nearline product supported mass capacity revenue of $1.9 billion, down 6% sequentially but up 18% compared with the prior-year period.
Shipment into the mass capacity market totaled 133 exabytes, down 3% sequentially and up 20% year over year. Our nearline product segment continues to grow, with revenue outpacing the broader mass capacity business once again. In the March quarter, we increased shipment to 117 exabytes, up 6% sequentially and 23% year on year, supported by the ongoing adoption of our 18-terabyte drives and initial volume shipments of our new 20-plus terabyte products. Our leading nearline portfolio, coupled with a very agile supply chain, resulted in record cloud market revenue in the March quarter.
Consistent with our comments in early March, demand for the VIA market were lower than anticipated due primarily to delayed project spending in China, resulting from disruption related to COVID and shifting government priorities. We do expect demand to improve once COVID-related restrictions begin to ease and project installation can resume. Within the legacy markets, revenue came in at $642 million, down 17% sequentially and 26% year over year. Quarter over quarter, the pace of decline was similar across each of the legacy end markets.
Based on diluted share count of approximately 222 million shares, non-GAAP EPS for the March quarter was $1.81, within our original guidance range and consistent with our update in early March. Inventory increased by $192 million to approximately $1.5 billion as we continue making strategic purchases of critical components, optimize use of ocean freight to reduce logistic costs and support future product demand. Given the current macro environment, we believe inventory around this level is appropriate for the next couple of quarters. Capital expenditures were $97 million for the quarter, up slightly quarter over quarter.
We ended the March quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion and total liquidity with approximately $2.9 billion, including our revolving credit facility. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.7 billion for the 12-month period ending in March, with our leverage ratio declining slightly to 2.1 times. Total debt balance at the end of the quarter declined to $5.6 billion, reflecting the planned repayment of $220 million in debt during the March quarter. In summary, while the March quarter was very challenging, we delivered top and bottom-line results which were within our original guidance range with agile operational execution and ongoing focus on optimizing profitability and free cash flow generation.
Entering the June quarter, the operating environment has remained challenging. We have not yet seen an improvement relative to COVID shutdowns in China that we anticipated in early March, and non-HDD component shortages and geopolitical dynamics have intensified. As a result, we expect these external factors to constrain demand growth over the near term. With that in mind, we expect June quarter revenue to be in the range of $2.8 billion plus or minus $150 million.
We marked Earth Day this year with the release of our 16th Global Citizenship annual report and announcement of two important goals that reflect our deep commitment to sustainability. The first goal is to utilize 100% renewable energy across our global footprint by 2030. The second is to achieve net-zero carbon footprint by 2040, done in collaboration with our customers to eliminate Scope 3 emissions and, in turn, support their environmental goals. We continue to see opportunities to partner more closely with customers for the benefit of sustainability as well as circularity.",11.0,Low
STX,2022,4,"Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to today's call. Joining me are Dave Mosley, Seagate's chief executive officer; and Gianluca Romano, our chief financial officer. We've posted our earnings press release and detailed supplemental information for our June quarter and fiscal year 2022 results on the Investors section of our website.
During today's call, we will refer to GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP figures are reconciled to GAAP figures in the earnings press release posted on our website and included on our Form 8-K that was filed with the SEC. We've not reconciled certain non-GAAP outlook measures because the material items that may impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Therefore, a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable efforts.
Thank you, Shanye, and welcome to those of you joining us on today's call. Our June quarter financial results reflected near-record data center demand contrasted with impacts from a confluence of macro headwinds in other end markets, particularly in the consumer-facing legacy markets. We believe the secular data trends driving long-term demand growth for mass capacity storage and infrastructure remain intact, as I will discuss a bit later. However, the impacts from COVID lockdowns in Asia, non-HDD component shortages, and global inflationary pressures intensified late in the quarter.
The 20-plus terabyte product family is based on our highly successful common platform design, which has enabled us to scale and ramp to yield quickly as evidenced by the results I just shared. We have the flexibility to extend into the mid- to upper 20-terabyte capacity points with minimal changes to our design, which allows us to meet customers' timing, readiness and offers an attractive cost profile for both customers and for Seagate. We have worked tirelessly over the last three to four years, improving the resilience of our supply chain, aligning our mass capacity product portfolio to our customers' needs, and strengthening our financial foundation. Our operational execution, combined with structural changes that have taken place in the industry, namely the transition to mass capacity products and increased supply discipline, support our view that the company is fundamentally stronger today and better positioned for the future.
Let us now turn to the current market environment. Despite the ongoing impacts of COVID lockdowns and supply challenges, mass capacity revenue was flat quarter over quarter due in part the strong cloud customer adoption of our 20-plus terabyte nearline drives. U.S. cloud data center demand remains strong.
However, persistent non-HDD component shortages have led to inventory imbalances, precluding new data center build-outs from being completed. These, along with other supply disruptions have led to a buildup in inventory levels across a broad spectrum of customers, a trend that continued through the end of the quarter. As macro uncertainties and inflationary pressures intensify, we expect customers will increasingly focus on reducing their inventory levels while maintaining the ability to address end market demand. At the same time, our Asia-based cloud customers are dealing with the impacts of COVID restrictive measures, which have had far-reaching effects across all of the end markets that we serve in the region.
In the VIA markets, recall that many of the major projects driving demand are in the Asia region, particularly in China, where lockdowns are impacting our near-term revenue. While the situation remains fluid, we are confident that mass capacity demand growth will resume once lockdowns ease and inventory levels normalize. Within the legacy markets, demand rapidly deteriorated at the end of the quarter as lockdowns and surging inflation severely impacted consumer spending for PCs and external drives. Exiting the June quarter, the legacy business represented only 20% of our HDD revenue, which is a historic low.
In response to the current business conditions, Seagate is taking actions to maintain strong supply discipline and a favorable pricing environment. We are reducing our manufacturing production plans while continuing to focus on driving efficiencies in the factory and across supply chains. We are maintaining prudent cost controls across the business and executing our product road map, which also helps to support our customers' TCO objectives. While the current environment is challenging, the multiple secular drivers fueling long-term demand for mass capacity storage have not changed, and in fact, continue to expand.
CORVAULT has also gained customer attention with its unique autonomous drive regeneration technology, which combines our device and systems expertise to enable self-healing capabilities. These systems provide enterprise CIOs with peace of mind that their data will be protected while offering a strong TCO value proposition. Additionally, technologies such as self-healing distributed data protection, and secure erase play a critical role in reducing the environmental impact of our products. Drives with these technologies can be repaired, reused, or recycled rather than just discarded thus helping to preserve the Earth's precious resources.
These efforts are critically important to Seagate and a key pillar of our product circularity strategy. We are also receiving very positive feedback from customers on a global basis for our work in this area. In closing, Seagate has broad exposure to the strong secular tailwinds driving demand for mass capacity storage. These trends remain intact, which lends confidence that growth will resume the supply constraints and COVID lockdown impacts ease.
Seagate is fundamentally a stronger company today and is exceptionally well positioned to endure the current market environment. We have the right product portfolio, deep customer relationships, and operational agility to optimize profits and fuel growth. I'll now hand the call over to Gianluca to discuss the financial results.
Thank you, Dave. While demand for our mass capacity products remained very healthy in the June quarter, the intensifying economic pressures, buildup of inventory at our customers, and COVID restrictive measures that Dave discussed earlier and a more significant impact on our results than we were anticipating, particularly in the legacy business. Despite lower-than-anticipated revenue levels, and extraordinary cost pressures. Our non-GAAP gross margin expanded slightly to 29.3% in the June quarter, with HDD gross margin remaining comfortably inside our target range of 30% to 33%.
Our results are due in part to steady demand for our mass capacity products and a mix shift toward higher capacity drives. In the June quarter, total hard disk drive capacity shipments increased slightly to 155 exabytes, of which the mass capacity market made up 90% of the total with shipments of 129 exabytes, up 4% sequentially and 12% year over year. Our nearline product contributed 119 exabyte, up 1% sequentially and 17% year on year, bolstered by strong U.S. cloud customer demand for our 20-plus terabyte product family.
Finally, revenue for our non-HDD business was $218 million, down about 8% sequentially and 21% year over year. We saw a sharp uptick in our system business as we were able to mitigate some of the component shortages we have been experiencing, which enable us to begin shipping some of the record order backlog. However, component availability remains a challenge and impacted the SSD business during the quarter, leaving us unable to fulfill all the customer demand. We continue to work with our suppliers to support customer demand as constrained is.
Moving to our operational performance. Non-GAAP gross profit in the June quarter was $771 million, corresponding to non-GAAP gross margin of 29.3%, up 10 basis points quarter over quarter. As noted earlier, the increased mix of mass capacity products and transition to higher capacity drives more than offset lower business volumes and higher component costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $349 million, slightly up quarter over quarter and in line with our expectations as business travel and sales and marketing activity resumed.
Our resulting non-GAAP operating income was $422 million or 16.1% of revenue. We will continue to focus on managing costs and balancing supply with demand to position the company to expand operating margin back into the target range of 18% to 22% when top-line growth resumes, which we believe could begin later in the fiscal year. Based on diluted share count of approximately 217 million shares, non-GAAP EPS for the June quarter was $1.59. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow.
We currently expect continued growth in our annual free cash flow generation in fiscal 2023, depending on the pace of economic recovery. Consistent with our commitment to returning cash to shareholders we used $152 million for the quarterly dividend and $486 million to repurchase 6 million ordinary shares, exiting the quarter with 210 million shares outstanding. And approximately, $2.4 billion remaining in our authorization. Over the past two years, we have reported more than 20% of Seagate share outstanding at an average price of approximately $71 per share.
We ended the fiscal year with cash and cash equivalents of $650 million, and total liquidity was approximately $2.4 billion, including our revolving credit facility. Total debt balance at the end of the quarter was relatively flat with the prior period at $5.6 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.5 billion for fiscal '22 resulting in total debt-to-leverage ratio of 2.2 times. As we enter fiscal 2023, we expect macro uncertainties and non-HDD component shortages to continue pressuring our end market over the near term.
Thanks, Gianluca. Last quarter, I expressed confidence in the long-term growth trajectory of our business, and that view holds firm today. The multiple secular trends fueling demand for mass capacity HDD storage also catalyze growth for our system solutions and Lyve services business and Seagate is well positioned to benefit. Our products are funded on our drive innovation, and we continue to execute our strong HDD product road maps.",11.0,Low
STX,2023,1,"Good morning, and welcome to the Seagate Technology fiscal first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Shanye Hudson, senior vice president, investor relations, and treasury. Please go ahead.
During today's call, we'll refer to GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP figures are reconciled to GAAP figures in the earnings press release posted on our website and included in our Form 8-K that was filed with the SEC. We've not reconciled certain non-GAAP outlook measures because material items that may impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Therefore, a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable efforts.
Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security, or BIS, alleging violations of the U.S. export administration regulations. We have responded to the letter and believe that we've complied with all relevant export control laws and regulations. We've been cooperating with BIS, and we intend to continue engaging with them to seek a resolution.
For the September quarter, revenue came in at $2.04 billion, which was inside the revised guidance range that we provided at the end of August. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.48 was well below our expectations, impacted by multiple gross margin headwinds that I'll touch upon shortly. As we shared in late August, three main factors were influencing our outlook: the impact of COVID lockdowns and the related economic slowdown in China, broad-based customer inventory adjustments, and weakening global consumer spending. Since the August time frame, macro sentiment has further deteriorated, which has led to a more cautious spending environment and more significant inventory adjustments as we move through the final weeks of the September quarter.
It's important to note that consistent with some of the U.S. CSP comments, end-user demand for core data and analytics applications remain solid, which supports our view that the business will improve as elevated inventory levels are consumed. In the meantime, we continued to respond to the changing market conditions and further reduced production output across all product lines with the exception of our 20-plus terabyte products, where demand has held firm and pricing relatively stable. Our actions underscore our focus on maintaining strong supply discipline, and we believe this will enable us to quickly return to a more favorable pricing environment across mid- to lower-capacity products as conditions normalize.
Consistent with our focus on enhancing longer-term shareholder value, we are maintaining our quarterly dividend; however, we are temporarily pausing our share repurchase program to ensure we can continue to make necessary investments to support our current business and underpin our longer-term strategic plans. Let me now share some perspectives on the end markets, starting with VIA. The global economic slowdown has continued to impact VIA-related project budgets and installation time lines, which has led to a buildup of customer inventory. These trends have dampened the typically strong seasonality in the back half of the calendar year, particularly in the China market.
As a leader in HDD technology, Seagate is well-equipped to address demand by continuing to execute our strong product road map. We are leveraging the current production slowdown to double down on our development actions and accelerate cycles of learning to continue delivering TCO value to customers. Sales of our 20-plus terabyte product family grew meaningfully quarter over quarter, supported by strong demand from cloud customers. 20-plus terabyte drives now rank as our highest volume and revenue platform, surpassing 18 terabytes as expected.
We are extending this product family using conventional CMR technology into the mid-20 terabyte range, which also offers SMR capabilities into the upper 20-terabyte range. Development of our 30-plus terabyte platform based on HAMR technology remains firmly on track. In addition to HAMR, these drives incorporate many new technology innovations to reflect years of development, design, and integration know-how to form the backbone of our future product portfolio. We continue to execute our development plans meeting key milestones, including reliability metrics and aerial density gains that also position us to extend drive capacities well beyond 30 terabytes.
As I shared in our July earnings call, customer revenue shipments are expected to begin around mid-calendar 2023. And I could not be more pleased with our great progress this quarter. In closing, we are navigating through the macro challenges that are impacting our business over the near term. However, the long-term growth trajectory for mass capacity storage remains solid, driven by the fundamental demand for data and the need for businesses to harness its value.
We believe that the actions we have undertaken will ultimately strengthen our position over the long term. Looking ahead, as we incessantly push the technology innovation road map, we believe our customers will continue to value Seagate as their primary storage solutions provider. Gianluca will now cover the financial results in more detail.
And executing a restructuring plan to sustainably reduce our cost by approximately $110 million annualized. We believe this action will put the company in a strong financial position when the global macro business environment begins to recover and expand operating profit faster than revenue growth. Moving to our end markets. As we have mentioned, intensifying macroeconomic pressure and more reserved customer buying behavior impacted our results across both mass capacity and legacy markets.
On a revenue basis, mass capacity represented 78% of total HDD revenue at $1.4 billion in the September quarter. As a percentage of HDD revenue, mass capacity was down 2 percentage points sequentially and up 7 percentage points year on year. Consistent with our view at the end of August, VIA revenue was down quarter over quarter due mainly to the prolonged economic slowdown in China. Specific to our mass capacity market, we expect the prevailing macroeconomic challenges will extend through the December quarter, negating the traditional seasonal uptick usually seen in the VIA market.
As said, we remain confident in the long-term growth of the mass capacity markets in both the cloud and at the edge. Within the legacy markets, revenue was $391 million, down 20% sequentially. Quarter-over-quarter, the pace of decline was more pronounced in the mission-critical market due to soft enterprise spending, particularly in China, and deteriorating consumer spending. Similar to the VIA market, we do not expect to see a typical seasonal uptick in overall demand for legacy markets in the December quarter.
Finally, revenue for our non-HDD business was $263 million, up 21% sequentially. The increase quarter over quarter reflect the improving component supply for our petabyte scale solution in our enterprise system business. Moving to our operational performance. Non-GAAP gross profit in the September quarter was $498 million, corresponding to non-GAAP gross margin of 24.5%, down more than expected quarter over quarter.
Based on diluted share count of approximately 210 million shares, non-GAAP EPS for the September quarter was $0.48. Moving on to balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the September quarter with a total liquidity position of approximately $2.5 billion, including our revolving credit facilities, which is sufficient to support our strategic plans and meet customer demand. Despite lower-than-expected revenue for the September quarter, inventory ended fairly flat at just over $1.6 billion.
We expect inventory to decline significantly over the course of fiscal 2023 as we align our supply chain and finished good levels to the prevailing demand environment. Reflecting the payment of previously committed amount, capital expenditures were $133 million for the September quarter. Free cash flow generation was $112 million, essentially flat with the prior quarter, as the improvement in cash from operations was offset by higher capital expenditures. We used $147 million for the quarterly dividend, and $408 million, we reported 5.4 million ordinary shares, exiting the quarter with 206 million shares outstanding and approximately $1.9 billion remaining in our authorization.
In light of current near-term priorities, we are temporarily pausing our share repurchase program, but we remain flexible and opportunistic as conditions develop. In August, we raised $600 million in capital through a new term loan during fiscal 2028, resulting in total debt balance of $6.2 billion at the end of the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.1 billion for the last 12 months with total debt leverage ratio just below three times. We expect interest expense for the December quarter to be approximately $74 million.
We're taking the right actions to strengthen our near-term financial position and optimize liquidity through this period. We're driving forward on our technology road map which makes us poised to quickly recover, as market conditions improve, as well as capture the significant future opportunities ahead. Finally, we continue to operate with a deep sense of commitment to all of our stakeholders, our people, our customers, the communities in which we operate, and, of course, to our shareholders.

During today's call, we'll refer to GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP figures are reconciled to GAAP figures in the earnings press release posted on our website and included in our Form 8-K that was filed with the SEC. We've not reconciled certain non-GAAP outlook measures because material items that may impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Therefore, a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable efforts.
Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security, or BIS, alleging violations of the U.S. export administration regulations. We have responded to the letter and believe that we've complied with all relevant export control laws and regulations. We've been cooperating with BIS, and we intend to continue engaging with them to seek a resolution.
For the September quarter, revenue came in at $2.04 billion, which was inside the revised guidance range that we provided at the end of August. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.48 was well below our expectations, impacted by multiple gross margin headwinds that I'll touch upon shortly. As we shared in late August, three main factors were influencing our outlook: the impact of COVID lockdowns and the related economic slowdown in China, broad-based customer inventory adjustments, and weakening global consumer spending. Since the August time frame, macro sentiment has further deteriorated, which has led to a more cautious spending environment and more significant inventory adjustments as we move through the final weeks of the September quarter.
It's important to note that consistent with some of the U.S. CSP comments, end-user demand for core data and analytics applications remain solid, which supports our view that the business will improve as elevated inventory levels are consumed. In the meantime, we continued to respond to the changing market conditions and further reduced production output across all product lines with the exception of our 20-plus terabyte products, where demand has held firm and pricing relatively stable. Our actions underscore our focus on maintaining strong supply discipline, and we believe this will enable us to quickly return to a more favorable pricing environment across mid- to lower-capacity products as conditions normalize.
Consistent with our focus on enhancing longer-term shareholder value, we are maintaining our quarterly dividend; however, we are temporarily pausing our share repurchase program to ensure we can continue to make necessary investments to support our current business and underpin our longer-term strategic plans. Let me now share some perspectives on the end markets, starting with VIA. The global economic slowdown has continued to impact VIA-related project budgets and installation time lines, which has led to a buildup of customer inventory. These trends have dampened the typically strong seasonality in the back half of the calendar year, particularly in the China market.
As a leader in HDD technology, Seagate is well-equipped to address demand by continuing to execute our strong product road map. We are leveraging the current production slowdown to double down on our development actions and accelerate cycles of learning to continue delivering TCO value to customers. Sales of our 20-plus terabyte product family grew meaningfully quarter over quarter, supported by strong demand from cloud customers. 20-plus terabyte drives now rank as our highest volume and revenue platform, surpassing 18 terabytes as expected.
We are extending this product family using conventional CMR technology into the mid-20 terabyte range, which also offers SMR capabilities into the upper 20-terabyte range. Development of our 30-plus terabyte platform based on HAMR technology remains firmly on track. In addition to HAMR, these drives incorporate many new technology innovations to reflect years of development, design, and integration know-how to form the backbone of our future product portfolio. We continue to execute our development plans meeting key milestones, including reliability metrics and aerial density gains that also position us to extend drive capacities well beyond 30 terabytes.
As I shared in our July earnings call, customer revenue shipments are expected to begin around mid-calendar 2023. And I could not be more pleased with our great progress this quarter. In closing, we are navigating through the macro challenges that are impacting our business over the near term. However, the long-term growth trajectory for mass capacity storage remains solid, driven by the fundamental demand for data and the need for businesses to harness its value.
We believe that the actions we have undertaken will ultimately strengthen our position over the long term. Looking ahead, as we incessantly push the technology innovation road map, we believe our customers will continue to value Seagate as their primary storage solutions provider. Gianluca will now cover the financial results in more detail.
And executing a restructuring plan to sustainably reduce our cost by approximately $110 million annualized. We believe this action will put the company in a strong financial position when the global macro business environment begins to recover and expand operating profit faster than revenue growth. Moving to our end markets. As we have mentioned, intensifying macroeconomic pressure and more reserved customer buying behavior impacted our results across both mass capacity and legacy markets.
On a revenue basis, mass capacity represented 78% of total HDD revenue at $1.4 billion in the September quarter. As a percentage of HDD revenue, mass capacity was down 2 percentage points sequentially and up 7 percentage points year on year. Consistent with our view at the end of August, VIA revenue was down quarter over quarter due mainly to the prolonged economic slowdown in China. Specific to our mass capacity market, we expect the prevailing macroeconomic challenges will extend through the December quarter, negating the traditional seasonal uptick usually seen in the VIA market.
As said, we remain confident in the long-term growth of the mass capacity markets in both the cloud and at the edge. Within the legacy markets, revenue was $391 million, down 20% sequentially. Quarter-over-quarter, the pace of decline was more pronounced in the mission-critical market due to soft enterprise spending, particularly in China, and deteriorating consumer spending. Similar to the VIA market, we do not expect to see a typical seasonal uptick in overall demand for legacy markets in the December quarter.
Finally, revenue for our non-HDD business was $263 million, up 21% sequentially. The increase quarter over quarter reflect the improving component supply for our petabyte scale solution in our enterprise system business. Moving to our operational performance. Non-GAAP gross profit in the September quarter was $498 million, corresponding to non-GAAP gross margin of 24.5%, down more than expected quarter over quarter.
Based on diluted share count of approximately 210 million shares, non-GAAP EPS for the September quarter was $0.48. Moving on to balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the September quarter with a total liquidity position of approximately $2.5 billion, including our revolving credit facilities, which is sufficient to support our strategic plans and meet customer demand. Despite lower-than-expected revenue for the September quarter, inventory ended fairly flat at just over $1.6 billion.
We expect inventory to decline significantly over the course of fiscal 2023 as we align our supply chain and finished good levels to the prevailing demand environment. Reflecting the payment of previously committed amount, capital expenditures were $133 million for the September quarter. Free cash flow generation was $112 million, essentially flat with the prior quarter, as the improvement in cash from operations was offset by higher capital expenditures. We used $147 million for the quarterly dividend, and $408 million, we reported 5.4 million ordinary shares, exiting the quarter with 206 million shares outstanding and approximately $1.9 billion remaining in our authorization.
In light of current near-term priorities, we are temporarily pausing our share repurchase program, but we remain flexible and opportunistic as conditions develop. In August, we raised $600 million in capital through a new term loan during fiscal 2028, resulting in total debt balance of $6.2 billion at the end of the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.1 billion for the last 12 months with total debt leverage ratio just below three times. We expect interest expense for the December quarter to be approximately $74 million.
We're taking the right actions to strengthen our near-term financial position and optimize liquidity through this period. We're driving forward on our technology road map which makes us poised to quickly recover, as market conditions improve, as well as capture the significant future opportunities ahead. Finally, we continue to operate with a deep sense of commitment to all of our stakeholders, our people, our customers, the communities in which we operate, and, of course, to our shareholders. Gianluca and I would like to now take your questions.",11.0,Low
ULTA,2022,1,"Good afternoon, and welcome to Ulta Beauty's conference call to discuss results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. And it is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Kiley Rawlins, vice president of investor relations.
We also increased the number of members in our Ultimate Rewards Loyalty Program, introduced innovative digital experiences for our guests and continued to execute major strategic projects, including investments in new stores, supply chain and technology infrastructure, all while successfully navigating supply chain challenges, a tight labor market and operating cost pressures. I want to express my sincere appreciation to all of our Ulta Beauty associates for their collaborative efforts to create great guest experiences, execute against our plans and deliver these outstanding results. Consumers continue to be highly engaged with the beauty category as they participate in more in-person activities, engage in more travel and lean into experiential spending. And while macroeconomic pressures, such as rising inflation are top of mind for consumers, their resilience and emotional connection to beauty continues to drive the recovery of the category.
This consumer demand, paired with strong execution of our strategic priorities, fueled our exceptional results. Looking at our operational performance for the quarter, I will focus on the progress we are making with our consumer-facing priorities and then share an update on our optimization efforts. Let's start with our first strategic priority to drive disruptive growth through an expanded definition of All Things Beauty. From a category perspective, fragrance and bath, hair care, makeup and skin care all delivered double-digit comp growth against the first quarter last year.
Importantly, sales of makeup exceeded pre-pandemic levels in both mass and prestige cosmetics. The makeup recovery is progressing faster than we expected coming into this year. Compared to the first quarter of 2021, prestige cosmetics outperformed mass cosmetics, driven by new and expanding brands and a strong 21 Days of Beauty event. From a trend standpoint, foundation, concealers, eyeliners, and lipstick continue to deliver strong comp growth.
At the end of the first quarter, more than 280 brands offered certified products in at least one pillar. And while we continue to certify existing brands and SKUs, many new brands are launching with certification in place. One such example is Andrew Fitzsimons, a hair care brand that offers proprietary bonding technology at accessible price points, which was certified across all four pillars when it launched in the first quarter. Another example is Sk*p, an Ulta Beauty exclusive hair and body care brand packaged in a fully recyclable, shower-friendly paper beauty carton, which also launched in the first quarter.
We also introduced innovative AR and virtual reality experiences to support our launch of Fenty Beauty and r.e.m. Beauty. Finally, we continue to enhance and expand our partnership with Target. This leading partnership is part of our long-term strategy to build brand loyalty and engagement with Ulta Beauty.
The media network offers advertising, access fee display, video, search, product listing ads, social and influencers on both open web platforms and Ulta Beauty-owned properties. In addition to unlocking a new income stream while helping brand partners build digital campaigns to effectively engage audiences, we expect to see sales benefits as campaigns lead consumers back to Ulta Beauty properties to transact. Underlying these customer-facing priorities is a focus on to drive operational excellence and optimization. Last fall, we shared our updated supply chain strategy, including our plan to build market fulfillment centers, or MFCs, to supplement our existing DC network capacity and provide greater speed to stores and e-commerce guests in specific markets.
We recently broke ground on our first MFC in Greenville, South Carolina, and expect the facility will be fully operational in the third quarter next year. In addition, our planned retrofit of our full service distribution center in Greenwood, Indiana is on track to be complete in the second quarter of 2023. I am confident our infrastructure investments, including key supply chain and IT investments, will enable Ulta Beauty to continue to deliver strong results and capitalize on future growth opportunities. In closing, a few weeks ago, I had the privilege to welcome nearly 2,000 members of the Ulta Beauty team to our annual field leadership meeting, bringing together our general managers, district managers, field support teams and brand partners for several days of recognition, leadership development and product education.
Product prices and operating costs are rising and consumers are increasingly concerned about the impact of inflation. While it is difficult to forecast how inflation may impact consumer behavior going forward, we are monitoring guest engagement and remain encouraged by the underlying trends we see in our business and in the beauty category. I am confident our team will continue to navigate near-term pressures, and I remain excited about the long-term opportunity for Ulta Beauty to continue to deliver profitable growth. And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results.
Robust top line growth due to several factors, including the continued resilience of the beauty category, stronger-than-expected store performance and the impact of new brand launches drove better-than-expected leverage in both gross margin and SG&A, resulted in record operating margin of 18.7%. Now, let's dig into the details of our results. Starting with sales. Net sales for the quarter increased 21%, driven by 18% growth in comp sales, an increase in other revenue and strong new store performance.
For the quarter, gross margin increased 120 basis points to 40.1% of sales compared to 38.9% last year. The increase was primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, the growth of other revenue and favorable channel mix, partially offset by lower merchandise margin. Robust top line growth and benefits from our occupancy cost optimization efforts resulted in meaningful leverage of store fixed costs. Despite experiencing double-digit growth in supply chain costs, primarily resulting from increases in wage rates, transportation costs and fuel surcharges, strong top line growth during the quarter enabled us to leverage supply chain costs.
Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 53.7% to $6.30 per share compared to $4.10 per share last year. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 16% to $1.57 billion compared to $1.35 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 28 additional stores, the increase reflects inventory purchases to support key brand launches, as well as continued efforts to maintain strong in-stock of key items to support expected demand and mitigate anticipated global supply chain disruptions.
We now expect net sales to be between $9.35 billion and $9.55 billion with comp sales growth between 6% and 8%. Our updated outlook reflects trends year-to-date while continuing to consider uncertainties that could impact the second half of the year, including inflationary risk to consumer spending and the impact of increased points of distribution for Prestige Beauty. We anticipate comp growth will be in the low to mid-teens in the first half and then moderate to low single-digit growth in the second half. We now expect operating margin for the year to be between 14.1% and 14.4% of sales.
In closing, fiscal 2022 is off to a great start, but uncertainties remain. Our updated outlook reflects stronger top line performance and greater cost pressures, as well as economic and global uncertainties that could adversely impact consumer spending later in the year. While our updated expectations for fiscal 2022 are above our longer-term targets for comp sales and operating margin, we are not changing our long-term financial targets at this time, given our limited visibility into the economic environment and expected cost pressures as we move through the rest of the year and into 2023. And now, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session.",15.0,Negligible
ULTA,2022,2,"Good afternoon, and welcome to Ulta Beauty's conference call to discuss results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. [Operator instructions] And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. And it is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Kiley Rawlins, vice president of investor relations.
Their collaborative commitment to serving our guests, caring for each other and executing our plans with absolute excellence has enabled us to continue navigating a dynamic environment and deliver outstanding results. The strength in our business, despite a turbulent environment reflects the power of our differentiated model and our ability to capitalize on the strength of the overall beauty category. Our unique enduring value proposition continues to drive our success and our strategic framework anchors our focus as we look forward. This afternoon, I want to share an update on our strategic progress.
Our first strategic priority is to drive disruptive growth through an expanded definition of all things beauty. We engage into light beauty enthusiasts with a curated differentiated assortment focused on inclusivity and leading trends, and this approach continues to deliver results. From a category perspective, fragrance and bath, skincare, haircare and makeup all exceeded expectations, delivering double-digit comp growth against the second quarter last year. We are encouraged that the vast majority of our comparable sales growth was fueled by growth from both core and newness with a modest benefit from recently executed price increases.
Haircare, our second largest category, delivered another quarter of double-digit growth driven by newness and strong engagement in our semiannual Gorgeous Hair Event, a strategic event designed to acquire new guests, increase existing member spend and drive salon penetration. New brands like OLAPLEX, as well as new product launches from Way and Living Proof, contributed to the category growth in the quarter and the initial launch of Dyson's latest Airwrap styling tool with new features and attachment sold out quickly. Guests continue to engage with core professional brands like Redken and Pureology, and our salon backbar takeovers drove strong growth with Joico and recently launched Andrew Fitzsimons. Skincare was one of our best-performing categories this quarter with both prestige and mass delivering double-digit comp growth, driven by new brands and product innovation.
And Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty continues to resonate with guests as it addresses these interests. At the end of the second quarter, 290 brands offered certified products in at least one Conscious Beauty pillar, including newly certified brands, Born Dreamer, About-Face, SE, and Good Light. To increase the visibility of Conscious Beauty and to make it easier for guests to identify products that align with what is important to them, this quarter we refreshed the landing page on ulta.com and added digital badging to all product pages. Now guests can quickly identify certified brands and products across our Conscious Beauty pillars, whether shopping in stores or on our digital channels.
Through this program, we will provide eight diverse leaders, founders and entrepreneurs with resources, mentorship and support to prepare them for retail readiness. I look forward to sharing more about our inaugural class on future calls. Finally, we continue to enhance our wellness shop to support guests as they prioritize self-care. This quarter, we expanded the shop to additional stores and now roughly 750 stores offer guests an elevated cohesive presentation of wellness products to help them easily navigate their personal journey.
This quarter, we introduced new, more engaging products on both ulta.com and our mobile app. We are also improving our physical store experience. Next month, we plan to introduce a new front of store presentation that will allow us to enhance our ability to support more editorial storytelling around newness, events and trends. And later this fall, we will introduce a new layout in select stores to elevate key growth categories, unify the presentation of skincare and makeup, and enhance the store -- the services experience.
Longer term, we are exploring innovative ways to connect our digital and physical stores and deliver forward-thinking guest experiences. This quarter, we officially launched Prisma Ventures, a $20 million fund focused on investing in early stage start-ups and emerging tech entrepreneurs who will shape the future of retail and beauty. To date, the fund has partnered and invested in a variety of start-ups to enable greater personalization, including Haut.AI, Adeptmind, Revea, and ReStyle. And we recently announced an investment in LUUM, a start-up that provides robotic lash extensions, opening new intersections between beauty and robotics.
We are seeing encouraging engagement in these offers, resulting in increases in spend per member. As promotional intensity increases in beauty and across retail, these capabilities enable us to rely less on mass market promotions and leverage more targeted and profitable offers. In May, we launched UB Media, our new retail media network and the response from brand partners has been tremendous. Our brand partners are excited about the opportunity to leverage the power of our exclusive first-party data to transform the way they connect with beauty enthusiasts.
Our team is ramping up well, and we remain excited about the opportunity to unlock a new income stream and drive sales as we enable our brand partners to engage consumers more effectively. In closing, I am incredibly pleased with the strength we have seen across our business so far this year. Our operational and financial performance is a testament to the power of our values-based culture, our business model and the important role beauty plays in our customers' lives. We recognize beauty is not immune to macroeconomic challenges, but the category's deep emotional connection has historically resulted in stronger resilience compared to other discretionary categories.
And as our results illustrate, we believe this is even more true today given the importance of self-care and wellness. As we look to the future, we know there will be challenges, particularly with the wide-ranging impact of rising inflation, both on our business and our guests. But we remain confident in the resilience of the beauty category and our ability to lead the beauty category and drive long-term profitable growth. And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results.
Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave indicated, our second quarter results were better than we expected. Strong sales growth due to several factors, including the resilience of the beauty category, stronger-than-expected sales growth from stores, and the impact of new brands, drove better-than-expected performance in gross margin and SG&A leverage, resulting in an operating margin of 17%. These results reflect the hard work and commitment of our associates, and I want to thank all of our teams for staying focused on serving our guests and managing our business through this dynamic operating environment.
Average units per transaction were down slightly. The increase in average selling price primarily reflects the impact of product mix and retail price increases executed this year. We estimate that price increases contributed about 300 basis points to the overall comp. During the quarter, we opened seven new stores and relocated four stores.
We are also working with and supporting retail industry organizations and the Buy Safe Coalition to address opportunities at the legislative level. These gross margin headwinds were partially offset by leverage of fixed costs due to the strong top-line growth and an increase in other revenue. Double-digit growth in supply chain costs persisted into the second quarter, driven by increased freight costs and higher wage rates in our distribution centers. Strong top-line growth enabled us to mitigate the gross margin impact this quarter but as sales growth moderates, we continue to expect that higher supply chain costs, including fuel costs, which are expected to remain above last year, will be a larger headwind to gross margin in the second half of the year.
Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 25% to $5.70 per share, compared to $4.56 per share last year. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 15.4% to $1.67 billion, compared to $1.44 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 29 additional stores, the increase reflects inventory purchases to support key brand launches and increases in inventory costs as well as ongoing efforts to maintain strong in-stocks of key items to support expected demand.
We now expect net sales to be between $9.65 billion and $9.75 billion, with comp sales growth between 9.5% and 10.5%. Our updated outlook reflects year-to-date trends while continuing to consider uncertainties that could impact the second half of the year, particularly during the holiday season. Embedded in our forecast is an expectation for mid-single-digit comp growth in the second half, reflecting the risk of potential shifts in consumer spending due to inflationary pressures, the impact of increased points of distribution for prestige beauty and the likelihood of a more promotional holiday season. We now expect operating margin for the year will be between 14.6% and 14.8% of sales.
These assumptions result in updated full year guidance for diluted EPS growth between $20.70 and $21.20. One final update. We now expect to spend between $350 million and $400 million in capex in fiscal 2022, including approximately $195 million for supply chain and IT, $180 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, and about $20 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be around $250 million.
In closing, we are very pleased with our performance year to date. While we continue to face uncertainties in the current macro environment, we are focused on delivering great guest experiences and driving sustained profitable growth. Longer term, we believe the beauty category will continue to be resilient, and we are confident that we are differentiated and proven model and growth strategy, combined with our outstanding associates will continue to position Ulta Beauty as the preferred beauty destination. And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session.",15.0,Negligible
VFC,2022,1,"Good morning and welcome to VF Corporation's First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Conference Call. Participants on today's call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC. Unless otherwise noted amounts referred to on today's call will be on an adjusted constant dollar basis, which we defined in the press release that was issued this morning. We use adjusted constant dollar amounts as lead numbers in our discussion because we believe they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business.
Thank you, John and good morning everyone. Welcome to our first quarter call. We are encouraged by the strong start to our fiscal 2022 year. Our teams delivered an outstanding first quarter powering VF back to pre-pandemic revenue levels while driving an earnings recovery well ahead of our initial expectations.
We continue to see broad based momentum across the portfolio, which furthers my confidence in our ability to accelerate growth through fiscal 2022 and beyond. While the near-term environment remains somewhat clouded by virus surges in Southeast Asia, uncertainties in other regions brought on by the impact of new variants and further pressures on the global supply chain, our teams are executing. We remain focused on the things that we can control and winning the parts of our business with the consumers coming back strong. And we remain confident in our ability to continue driving this sharp recovery across our business. Matt, will walk you through our results in detail, but I'll start off with some Q1 highlights. VF revenue has surpassed pre-pandemic levels growing 96% or 83% organically to $2.2 billion with momentum across brands, regions, and channels.
Now, turning to our brand highlights from the quarter. The Vans brand as returned to pre-pandemic revenue levels growing 102% in Q1. The recovery has been led by global DTC business, which drove double-digit growth relative to fiscal 2020 led by 73% growth in digital. This DTC strength has been broad based with each region reporting positive DTC growth relative to pre-pandemic levels. More Vans consumers have returned to in-person shopping experiences earlier than expected and we see encouraging trends in our DTC KPIs with consumers buying more frequently and spending more per purchase relative to historic levels. In EMEA despite the continued impact of lockdowns and supply chain disruptions, the Vans business grew 125% this quarter representing 30% growth relative to fiscal 2020, with strength across all major markets as stores reopened throughout the region.
Vans APAC business grew 19% in Q1, led by 22% growth in China. June marked a milestone for the brand in China with the stock launch of the Vans Family program while the official launch will be celebrated with the Super Brand Day on Tmall tomorrow. We have already registered over one million new loyalty members following the initial launch bringing Global Vans Family membership to nearly 17 million consumers. Vans kicked off it's 52 week drop calendar this quarter seeking to create a consistent, predictable, globally aligned and focused approach to drive brand energy and consumer engagement. Seven weeks into the program, we are encouraged by the initial consumer reads and the instance sell out of several early drops. Internally, the Vans team has increased its focus, energy, and resources around driving newness and compelling storytelling, which we believe will unlock further long-term value for the brand. The team is on track to more formally market the Vans drop list in fiscal Q3 ahead of the fall holiday season. We remain bullish on the set up for Vans moving through fiscal 2022 and are encouraged by the early reads from the back to school season underway. We are raising off our full year outlook to growth of 28% to 29%, representing growth of 9% to 10% relative to fiscal 2020.
We continue to be encouraged by the broad-based global momentum at The North Face and now expect the brand delivered 26% to 27% growth this year, representing 15% to 17% growth relative to fiscal 2020. Alongside the significant top line recovery, we're seeing strong improvements in profitability and continue to expect mid teen profitability for TNF in fiscal 2022. The Timberland brand delivered 63% growth in Q1 tracking ahead of plan. We are encouraged by high-teens growth in the Americas, and 87% growth in digital relative to fiscal 2020 level. We continue to see outsized growth from Outdoor, Apparel, and Timberland PRO each growing over 75% in the quarter. Momentum behind core iconic product also continues with heritage styles being strong demand despite historically low inventories. Our Timberland team remains committed to its purpose led vision highlighted by the recently announced Global Product Take-Back Program in partnership with ReCircled.
Beginning this fall US consumers will be able to return any Timberland product to a brand store to either be refurbished for resale or recycled into future products. This program supports the brand's bold vision announced last fall for products to have a net positive impact on nature by 2030. We are encouraged by Timberland's strong start to the year and as a result, we now expect the brand to deliver modest growth relative to fiscal 2020 surpassing pre-pandemic revenues beginning in Q2. Dickies delivered another exceptional quarter, growing 58% in Q1, well ahead of our plan as the brand has kicked off several new campaigns and inventories become more available, we've been pleasantly surprised by the intensity of sell-through performance across all wholesale partners in the US. This acceleration continues to be driven by both Work-Inspired Lifestyle product, which reported strong growth across all three regions as well as core work items. Work-Inspired Lifestyle now represents about 40% global brand revenue. Importantly, the Dickies brand has begun to deliver meaningful profitability improvements, driven by both gross margin expansion and SG&A efficiencies. Q1 represented a strong start to our goal of returning to double-digit profit margins in the Work segment in fiscal 2022.
A quick update on Supreme we continue to be happy with the integration process. The VF's supply chain organization continues to advance engagement with the Supreme teams with particular leverage opportunities in logistics capabilities, scale and relationships, which couldn't come in a more opportune time. One quarter into our fiscal year, we remain confident in our outlook of $600 million and $0.25 from the brand. Before I turn the call over to Matt, I want to thank our associates from around the world, across our brands and enterprise functions with a particular call out to our supply chain teams who have been working tirelessly over the past 18 months to minimize disruption against the backdrop of unprecedented volatility. Our strong results are reflection of the consistent execution, hard work and inspiring dedication of our teams around the world. This continued passion and energy alongside the broad based nature of VF's acceleration give me great confidence in our ability to continue driving the strong recovery underway.
Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'm really happy to update you on our strong Q1 results and revised outlook for the year. We are encouraged by the continued broad-based momentum across our business and the set up for each of our big brands heading into the heart of our fiscal year. Despite additional pressures throughout the global supply chain. I remain confident in our team's ability to execute and to build on the strong earnings recovery delivered in Q1.
Moving onto the EMEA region, while lockdown measures continue to affect economic activity our business has remained resilient. Growing 97% organically in Q1, representing 13% growth relative to fiscal 2020. Both wholesale and DTC channels returned to growth relative to 2020. As continued strength from both our direct digital channel and from digital tightened partners have more than offset the impact of brick and mortar store closures. About 60% of our EMEA stores were closed at the start of the first quarter. As we sit here today, all of those doors have now reopened. Consumer confidence is improving as restrictions ease and we've seen strong performance from our brick and mortar fleet following reopening. For example, our UK business delivered triple-digit growth from open doors following 3 months of lockdown, representing growth of nearly 30%, relative to fiscal 2020.
Finally, our APAC region continues to deliver double-digit growth despite sporadic resurgence of the virus across many market. Our China business grew 12% in Q1, which was impacted by a wholesale timing shift of revenues from Q1 into Q2. Excluding this impact, China would have delivered mid teen growth this quarter. We continue to see digitally led growth in the region, particularly with our tightened partners and remain confident in our ability to deliver greater than 20% growth in China in fiscal 2022. While we remain pleased with our APAC performance to-date we are observing most Southeast Asian market facing various degrees of lockdowns and travel restrictions and while only about 5% of our stores are currently closed commercial activity has been impacted across most APAC markets outside of China and Hong Kong. This latest wave also presents additional near-term uncertainty for our global supply chain. In recent weeks more widespread virus outbreaks in key sourcing countries with lower levels of vaccinations have resulted in temporary factory lockdowns and manufacturing capacity constraints.
Our supply chain also continues to be impacted by port delays, equipment availability and other logistics challenges. Essentially, every link in the supply chain has been impacted to varying degrees over the last 18 months. And while we're not immune to this, we believe we've managed these challenges relatively better than most. Our teams remain focused on delivering the products to satisfy increasing demand signals in the most cost effective and efficient way. Some of the actions include using air freights, other means of expedited shipping and dual sourcing where appropriate. While we remain confident in our ability to service our strong growth plan, there is a financial implications to these actions. For example, we expect to spend more than $35 million in incremental expedited freight charges relative to fiscal 2020. We view our supply chain is a key competitive advantage of VF and our teams are proving this now more than ever. I want to echo Steve's appreciation for the supply chain teams' incredible execution over the past 18 months. As a result of their tireless and tremendous effort, I remain confident in our ability to continue navigating this dynamic environment.
When compared to fiscal 2020 gross margins, we generated a strong mix benefit, partially offset by the incremental air freight costs and FX. Operating margin expanded meaningfully to 6.8% driven by the strong gross margin performance and SG&A leverage relative to the prior year. We delivered EPS of $0.27 in Q1, representing 133% organic growth driven by a stronger top line and earnings flow through relative to our initial expectations. Owing to strong broad-based performance in Q1, we are raising our full-year fiscal 2022 outlook. Our outlook today assumes no significant changes to the environment, including increased disruption to our supply chain operations. VF's revenue is now expected to be at least $12 billion representing at least 30% growth from fiscal 2021 and mid-teen increase relative to our prior peak revenue in fiscal 2020. Excluding the Supreme business, our fiscal 2022 outlook implies organic growth of at least 25% representing at least 9% organic growth relative to fiscal 2020.
As Steve covered, the increase to our revenue guidance is broad based across the portfolio, the stronger outlooks for each of our top core brands and sizable increases in two of our emerging brands, Altra and SmartWool. Specifically, the improved outlooks are supported by stronger-than-anticipated order books and the accelerating DTC trends we've observed over the past five months.
As announced on June 28, we closed the sale of the Occupational Work business this quarter providing roughly $615 million of additional liquidity. These proceeds are reflected in our fiscal 2022 outlook for total liquidity to exceed $4 billion. We expect to exit this year with net leverage between 2.5 times and 3 times providing us meaningful near term optionality deploy excess capital moving forward.
So to conclude our prepared remarks, I'm extremely pleased with the broad based strength we're seeing across our portfolio as we begin fiscal 2022. We took bold decisive actions last year to position our brands and the enterprise with a strong recovery currently underway. And the balanced broad based nature of this recovery, along with the continued optionality that our model provides gives me confidence in our ability to drive sustainable long-term growth moving forward.",13.0,Negligible
VFC,2022,2,"Participants on today's call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC. Unless otherwise noted, amounts referred to on today's call will be on an adjusted constant dollar basis, which we've defined in the press release that was issued this morning. We use adjusted constant dollar amounts as lead numbers in our discussions because we believe they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business.
You may also hear us refer to reported amounts which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to adjusted amounts can be found in the supplemental financial tables included in the press release which identify and quantify all excluded items and provide management's view of why this information is useful to investors.
And despite a more challenging environment than we had envisioned, we are able to reaffirm our fiscal '22 revenue and earnings outlook; a clear testament to the resiliency and optionality of our model. We see our business emerging in an even stronger place than before the pandemic. We've accelerated our strategy to be a more digitally enabled enterprise for driving significant investment behind key capabilities to connect with our consumers. We are driving organic growth as we elevate direct channels, distort Asia, led by China, and accelerate our consumer-minded, retail-centric, hyper-digital business model transformation.
The September Vans Horror collection launch supported the fifth highest sales day on record for our Americas DTC digital business achieving a 100% sell-through within days. We are encouraged by the ongoing strength from Progression Footwear lines, up 15% relative to fiscal 2020 led by UltraRange and MTE and are pleased with the continued growth in Vans Family membership reaching 18.5 million consumers globally. Our confidence in the long-term runway for Vans remains unchanged. The brand came into this disruptive period exceptionally strong and consumer engagement has remained healthy. The active space remains a large and growing TAM and the casualization trend continues to present a long-term tailwind for Vans.
And although Vans remains a very important part of our story, we must remember that VF is not just one brand. We have a diversified portfolio of global brands, each with exposure to attractive TAMs with enduring tailwinds. We have significant shared platforms of expertise, highlighted by our international platforms and global supply chain, which are enabling broad-based profitable growth. And as a result, our model drives ongoing capital allocation optionality to further enhance VF's growth and shareholder return profile.
We believe the Timberland brand is in a much healthier position today relative to where it was before COVID. This leadership team has a sharpened focus on the brand's product architecture, getting back to Timberland's core, work and outdoor, sustainability and craftsmanship, while increasing energy and newness. They have refocused strategic clarity around the target consumer and on executing the right go-to-market set of choices. The brand is demonstrating strong marketplace discipline, reducing discounts and thoughtfully rebuilding depleted inventory while driving significant improvements in profitability.
The integration of Supreme continues to move according to plan and our teams are learning from this highly productive business, including how they manage product creation, building energy ahead of drops, and optimizing assortments in product flow across regions with great agility. Looking forward, we remain confident in the significant whitespace opportunity for this brand across geographies with a clear opportunity to leverage VF platforms. Supreme remains on track to become VF's fifth billion dollar brand in the coming years.
The Smartwool brand is up nearly 60% [Phonetic] year-to-date, representing high-teens growth relative to fiscal 2020. We've accelerated investment in brand awareness campaigns, highlighting the high performance and versatility of this product, while targeting an active, younger consumer. We're seeing it pay off with broad-based strength across categories, led by apparel and outsized growth from new consumers.
Our other natural fiber brand, icebreaker, has successfully relocated the core leadership team from New Zealand to our Stabio headquarters, further integrating into our EMEA platform, which will accelerate the brand's global reach. The brand has grown nearly 30% year-to-date with balanced growth across its largest markets in Europe and the U.S. Base layers, tees and underwear represent about 70% of icebreaker global revenue confirming the consumer appeal of a 100% natural product in next-to-skin categories.
And lastly, Altra, the fastest growing brand in our portfolio is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year by establishing its legendary Lone Peak franchise as the number one trail running business in the U.S. The brand has continued to build accolades from the running community with awards from Runners World, Self Magazine, Women's Health and Outside Magazine across multiple franchises. Through the first half of the year, the brand has grown over 60% relative to fiscal 2020 and we expect this to accelerate into the back half of the year as the brand continues to expand its presence in road running with innovative new styles and designs. We see tremendous opportunity for Altra to expand distribution domestically and internationally, leveraging its differentiated product and continued strong tailwinds for this category.
Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'm happy to give an update on our progress as we navigate the recovery and importantly, I am encouraged by the resiliency of our business during the first half of fiscal 2022.
The environment has clearly evolved differently than we had planned in May. However, our teams remain focused on what we can control, and they are delivering. The underlying topline recovery across the majority of our business has exceeded our plan, offsetting new challenges in the APAC region and ongoing disruptions across the supply chain network. With thoughtful allocation of investments, we've been able to drive continued strategic investment spending, while leveraging other parts of our SG&A base to protect earnings. As a result, I'm proud of our ability to hold on to our fiscal 2022 earnings outlook of about $3.20 despite a more challenging than anticipated operating environment, including an incremental headwind of about $0.09 from expedited freight. This should be a strong signal that this management team is committed to leveraging the significant optionality in our model to deliver on our earnings commitment.
Next, the EMEA region delivered mid-teen organic growth in Q2 despite meaningful supply chain disruption, particularly for The North Face. The underlying business continues to perform above the overall market, supported by strong performance of key Digital Titans. This region was strong before the pandemic and has shown incredible resiliency throughout this disruptive period. Stores are showing continuous recapture of volumes despite softer street traffic in large metro areas. We are encouraged to see the brick-and-mortar DTC business for both The North Face and Vans, and quite meaningfully this quarter, each returning to positive growth relative to fiscal year '20. Recovery momentum and sustained growth are expected to accelerate throughout the year as vaccine rollouts progress.
Finally, the APAC region delivered low-single-digit organic growth despite a more challenging backdrop than anticipated for parts of our portfolio. Due to a resurgence of COVID-19 across the region, economic growth and consumer confidence has softened since July. Parts of our business in China have been further impacted by weaker digital traffic for non-domestic brands. This has been more impactful for Active brands relative to Outdoor. Across the portfolio, we believe we are performing better in our respective categories versus other international brands. And while we remain bullish on the long-term opportunity in the region, these pressures have impacted our near-term outlook. We now expect low-teen growth in China in fiscal 2022.
Moving on to our global supply chain. The environment remains challenging and has continued to deteriorate following our Q1 call in late July. The resurgence of COVID-19 lockdowns in key sourcing countries like Vietnam have resulted in more impactful production delays and the logistics network continues to face unprecedented challenges. We are experiencing increasing product delays from the supply chain disruption, which is creating meaningful quarter-to-quarter volatility in our results.
Let me unpack all of this in a little more detail. Due to VF's large and strategically diversified sourcing footprint, our overall production capacity has remained better positioned than most with about 85% of production operational throughout the quarter. Pressures have generally concentrated in the southern region of Vietnam, which represents about 10% of VF's overall sourcing mix. We remain confident in our ability to navigate the production environment. However, the logistics network remains under increasing pressure. Ports are generally open, but operations remain severely impacted by labor and equipment availability, servicing significantly higher ship volumes. As a result, our dwell times at points of destination have increased significantly. In aggregate, supply delays are pervasive and, in some cases, have extended 8 weeks to 10 weeks. As a result, in the most recent quarter, we had a material shift of revenue from Q2 into Q3 with more than half of this tied to Vietnam. Despite these delays, cancellation rates have remained below historical levels, signaling strong demand and tight channel inventories.
However, delays ultimately impact product availability across the marketplace. Virtually all of our brands are experiencing delayed collections, style and, in some cases, insufficient size assortment, limiting their ability to fully meet strong demand. For example, the Supreme brand has experienced around 30% less inventory around drops. So despite strong sell-through trends, we are losing volume from limited supply. This environment is where our world class supply chain differentiates itself, highlighting the significant competitive advantage VF has created with its platform. We have always maintained a diversified sourcing footprint to provide resiliency against unforeseen changes in the operating or geopolitical environment. For example, our largest market, Vietnam, only represents about one-fourth of our sourcing mix. And within Vietnam, we work with multiple partners and have presence in multiple provinces, both between the northern and southern regions of the country, and maintain access to multiple ports.
Moving into some additional highlights on our second quarter. Total VF revenue increased 21% to $3.2 billion despite a significant amount of orders shifted from Q2 into Q3, implying continued sequential underlying improvement for the portfolio. For context, we estimate this shift represented a mid-to-high single-digit impact to VF's Q2 growth rate relative to fiscal 2020.
Now a few comments on our revised fiscal 2022 outlook. We are holding our revenue guidance to be about $12 billion despite a weaker China outlook in the near term and a lower than expected back-to-school performance at Vans in the U.S. and ongoing supply chain challenges; all of this, highlighting the broad-based strength across our brands and geographies. Our gross margin outlook is now about 56%, including 40 basis points of incremental freight cost relative to what we had expected in July, implying an improving underlying gross margin outlook. And adjusting for incremental freight and FX, our fiscal 2022 outlook implies over 100 basis points of underlying gross margin expansion relative to peak gross margins in fiscal 2020, driven by favorable mix and clean full price sell-through.
We are holding our operating margin outlook to around 13% for fiscal 2022 despite the incremental freight cost covered. As Steve said, we're focused on what we can control and for me, SG&A control is clearly top of mind. We are offsetting supply chain and distribution cost headwinds with spend reduction actions, while protecting strategic investments and demand creation. The business is driving impressive underlying leverage and our confidence is strong that we can continue to accelerate this over time.
Finally, as discussed, we are reaffirming our full year earnings outlook of around $3.20 despite about $0.09 of incremental costs directly attributed to the supply chain disruption; a strong testament of portfolio resiliency and the optionality of our model. Steve introduced an important concept that VF is not just one brand and I want to reiterate this as I conclude our prepared remarks.",13.0,Negligible
VRTX,2022,1,"We recommend that you access the webcast slides as you listen to this call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on our website. We will make forward-looking statements on this call that are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today's press release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements, including, without limitation, those regarding Vertex's marketed CF medicines, our pipeline, and Vertex's future financial performance are based on management's current assumptions.
and Europe with this disease; and three, the ability to conduct an interim analysis, which, if positive, could provide a pathway to accelerated approval in the U.S. Transitioning now to our pain program. In late March, we announced that VX-548, a novel first-in-class, non-opioid NaV1.8 inhibitor achieved statistically significant and clinically meaningful relief in two phase 2 studies of acute pain, meeting our high expectations. In the two studies, one following abdominoplasty and one following bunionectomy, VX-548 at the highest dose tested showed a rapid, sustained, and consistent decrease in pain intensity compared to placebo on the primary endpoint of SPID48, a time-weighted sum of the pain intensity difference from time of first dose to 48 hours.
There were no serious adverse events related to VX-548 and the majority of adverse events were mild or moderate. Given the high unmet need for an efficacious and well-tolerated, non-opioid pain medicine, we are working with urgency to advance VX-548. Our goal is to bring forward a novel class of pain treatment with the potential to provide effective pain relief without the addictive potential or adverse side effects of opioids. We plan to advance VX-548 into pivotal development for acute pain in the second half of 2022, pending discussions with regulators.
increased 55% over the first quarter of 2021 to $729 million, driven by rapid uptake of Trikafta/Kaftrio in countries where we reached reimbursement agreements. We started the year with more than 25,000 patients in North America, Europe, and Australia, who could benefit from a CFTR modulator but were not yet on therapy. These patients fell primarily into one of three categories: one, patients who have not yet initiated treatment, largely in countries where we are recently reimbursed and therefore, are early in the launch curve; two, patients in geographies where we are not yet reimbursed; and three, younger age groups who will be addressed through ongoing label expansions. We are confident in our ability to reach the vast majority of these patients over time.
and EU, and we are developing robust patient service programs to support patients throughout the treatment journey. We continue to see tremendous potential for CTX001 to help patients, and we look forward to the possibility of bringing this groundbreaking therapy to those living with sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. Finally, with the recent completion of the two phase 2 studies in acute pain and the positive POC results in both studies, as Reshma noted, we now plan to advance VX-548 into pivotal development in acute pain in the second half of this year. Let me review with you briefly the market opportunity we see in pain.
But the mechanism is applicable to other types of pain, as demonstrated by VX-150 which showed positive POC across acute, neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain. We look forward to discussing plans in these indications on future calls. I am very excited about our continued progress in bringing our CF medicines to more patients globally and about the promise of our late-stage pipeline. I will now turn the call over to Charlie.
Our first quarter 2022 combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were $687 million, compared to $531 million in Q1 2021. The year-over-year increase in expenses was driven by increased research costs and investments in our advancing pipeline with multiple programs now in mid- and late-stage development. Additionally, we continue to make investments in CTX001 pre-commercial activities in anticipation of regulatory filing by the end of this year. Starting in the first quarter of 2022 and going forward, consistent with reporting practices that have been recently adopted by peer companies, we no longer exclude from our non-GAAP results, research, and development charges from upfront or contingent milestone payments in connection with collaborations, asset acquisitions, or the licensing of third-party IP.
We have also updated prior year reported non-GAAP figures to be consistent with the new basis of presentation. This change in reporting affects only our non-GAAP numbers and the impacts on reported results for Q1 '22 and Q1 '21 were not material. Our continued strong revenue growth combined with our efficient operating model resulted in Q1 non-GAAP operating margin of 56% and non-GAAP operating income of $1.17 billion, an increase of 16% year over year. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2022 was 22%.
We ended the quarter with $8.2 billion in cash and short-term investments as we continue to maintain a very strong balance sheet profile. Now to guidance. We are maintaining our previously issued guidance for full year 2022 CF product revenue and non-GAAP effective tax rate. We are adjusting our guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to reflect the change in reporting of upfronts and milestones as I described moments ago.
Specifically, our guidance for total CF product revenue remains at $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion. At the midpoint, this is a year-over-year increase of approximately $1 billion or 12% growth. Non-GAAP operating expenses are now projected in a range of $2.82 billion to $2.92 billion, including potential upfront and milestone payments from existing or ongoing collaborations. Finally, we continue to project a non-GAAP effective tax rate in a range of 21% to 22%.
As we look out to the remainder of the year and into 2023, we have a number of important pipeline milestones that will demonstrate our continued progress, and these are shown on Slide 16 of the webcast. In summary, we are on track for our eighth consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth in 2022. The CF business is strong, and we have invested to maintain leadership in CF for the long term. At the same time, we are now going through an inflection point as a company well on our way to diversifying Vertex into new disease areas beyond CF as the broad pipeline of potentially transformative medicines advances.
As a result, our unique business strategy, which enables significant reinvestment in internal and external innovation while sustaining high profitability leaves us exceptionally well-positioned for further significant value creation over time. We look forward to updating you further as we progress through the year. Let's now open the call to questions.",23.0,Medium

Starting with CF. For patients who can benefit from CFTR modulators, TRIKAFTA has set a very high bar. But if it is possible to develop more effective medicines, we are determined to be the ones who do so. Our next-in-class triple combination, VX-121/tezacaftor/VX-561, is now in phase 3 development enrolling patients 12 years and older, and we remain on track to complete enrollment by the end of this year or early next.
And VX-548, a novel first-in-class NaV1.8 inhibitor. We have high expectations from this program because NaV1.8 is both a genetically and pharmacologically validated target across acute, neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain. And VX-548 demonstrated a very desirable benefit/risk ratio profile in phase 2. Additionally, the VX-548 program represents a near-term commercial opportunity.
To recap, earlier this year, we shared positive proof-of-concept results from VX-548, which demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful relief of pain in two phase 2 studies of acute pain, one in the post-bunionectomy setting and one in the post-abdominoplasty setting. Based on these results, the VX-548 has received Breakthrough Therapy designation, highlighting the significant need for highly efficacious and well-tolerated non-opioid pain medicines. We are very pleased to have completed our end of phase 2 meeting with the FDA and reach agreement on the VX-548 pivotal program in acute pain. The phase 3 program will include two randomized placebo-controlled trials that will evaluate VX-548 post-bunionectomy and abdominoplasty.
The exact same postsurgical acute pain settings we explored in phase 2. These trials are shortened duration, approximately two days of treatment followed by 14 days of safety follow-up. Both of these phase 3 studies will also include an opioid treatment arm. A third single-arm study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of dosing with VX-548 for up to 14 days across multiple other types of moderate to severe acute pain.
Thanks, Reshma. I'm pleased to review tonight our continued strong performance in CF, the path toward future growth and the commercial opportunity and plans for some of the most advanced disease areas in our pipeline. I'll start with CF. Our CF business continued its rapid pace of growth this quarter, with impressive performance in both the U.S.
and internationally. In the U.S., we continue to add new TRIKAFTA patients, with most of them being younger patients in the six to 11 age group, and persistence and compliance remain very high across all patient groups. Outside the U.S., we have seen rapid uptake of KAFTRIO across multiple European countries where we recently reached reimbursement agreements, notably France, Spain and Italy. We've now turned our focus in Europe to the launch of KAFTRIO in children ages six to 11.
Two, patients in geographies where we are not yet reimbursed and three, younger age groups who will be addressed through ongoing label expansions. We are confident in our ability to reach the vast majority of these patients over time. We have made good headway securing new reimbursements and launching our medicines in the first half of 2022. Additionally, we continue to make important progress in expanding access to younger patients.
For instance, we completed the study of TRIKAFTA in patients two to five years old with positive efficacy results on the endpoints of lung clearance index and sweat chloride and no new safety signals. We expect to present these data at a medical meeting later this year and are on track to submit global regulatory filings by the end of the year. Additionally, we submitted regulatory filings in the U.S. and Europe for ORKAMBI in patients 12 months to less than 24 months of age.
We see utility for our NaV1.8 inhibitors in different types of pain, including acute, neuropathic and musculoskeletal. Today, I'm going to focus on acute pain. In the U.S., there are approximately 1.5 billion treatment days for acute pain each year, and approximately two-thirds or 1 billion of those are driven by hospital prescribing. This includes treatment for inpatient and outpatient visits and the patient's related pain management following discharge.
With our strong financial profile, we expect to continue investing in both internal innovation with our rapidly advancing pipeline, as well as external innovation that fits with our R&D strategy and complements our existing portfolio. As a result, non-GAAP operating expenses for the year are now projected to be in a range of $3 billion to $3.1 billion, an increase from our previous guidance of $2.82 billion to $2.92 billion. The increase is primarily due to incremental expenses resulting from the advancement of our pipeline programs into late-stage clinical trials, particularly in pain and AMKD, as well as additional upfront and milestone payments. Finally, we continue to project a non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 22%.
We are developing these programs with the intent of creating transformative, high-value medicines, each of which represents a multibillion-dollar opportunity. Fueled by our success in CF, we can continue to invest in our advancing pipeline while also delivering exceptional profitability and cash flow.

next month and complete the submissions by the end of the first quarter of 2023. In Europe, we previously shared that we reached an agreement on the filing package with the EMEA and MHRA in the EU and U.K., respectively. We remain on track to submit these MAAs by the end of this year. Our teams are intensely focused on preparing these multiple complex submissions with three separate regulatory agencies in order to bring exa-cel to patients as quickly as possible.
VX-548 is a novel selective NaV1.8 inhibitor that offers the potential of highly effective pain relief without the side effects or addictive potential of opioids. NaV1.8 is both a genetically and pharmacologically validated target. Recall that VX-150, an earlier-generation NaV1.8 inhibitor, demonstrated positive proof of concept in acute, neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain. VX-548 has been studied in two phase 2 placebo-controlled acute pain studies and showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful pain relief compared to placebo and was generally well tolerated.
The design of the RCTs in the pivotal program is very similar to our phase 2 completed studies, same pain states, post bunionectomy and post abdominoplasty. Same treatment duration, 48 hours, and the same primary endpoint, the sum of pain intensity difference, or SPID, over 48 hours of VX-548 compared to placebo. A third single-arm study rounds out the phase 3 program. This study will enroll patients with multiple other types of moderate to severe acute pain with a treatment period of up to 14 days.
Given our experience in executing these types of trials efficiently, the short treatment duration, and the high unmet need for effective pain relief without the significant side effects or addictive potential of opioids, we view VX-548 as a near-term and significant market opportunity. We also plan to study VX-548 in neuropathic pain and remain on track to initiate a phase 2 dose-ranging proof-of-concept study in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy toward the end of this year. Moving to inaxaplin or VX-147, the first potential medicine to treat the underlying cause of APOL1-mediated kidney disease, or AMKD. Inaxiplin has breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S.
These patients fall primarily into the following categories: one, patients in countries where we are early on the launch curve, such as those with recently achieved reimbursement agreements or label extensions for younger patients; two, patients in younger age groups for whom we continue to pursue label and reimbursement extensions; and three, to a lesser extent, patients awaiting reimbursement for our medicines in a small number of countries. We are confident that we will reach the vast majority of these patients over time, which will drive continued revenue growth in the near and long term. We continue to make excellent progress in expanding the label for our CFTR modulators to younger age groups. In September, ORKAMBI was approved for children ages 12 months to less than 24 months in the U.S.
We expect to file for U.S. FDA approval of KALYDECO in children ages one month to less than four months before the end of 2022. Similarly, we will submit to the U.S. and other global regulatory authorities for approval of TRIKAFTA in children two to five years old by the end of the year.
Finally, in CF, as Reshma mentioned, our CFTR mRNA program is progressing toward an IND submission this year. This program targets the underlying cause of disease in approximately 5,000 CF patients worldwide. Beyond CF, we have a broad, diverse and advanced R&D pipeline. I will focus my comments on our commercial readiness efforts and the market opportunity for our potential next product launches, exa-cel and VX-548.
In parallel to engaging with these treatment centers, we have been working closely with policymakers and with payers to ensure that these stakeholders understand the significant burden of these diseases. Payment models are an important consideration, given the value that a one-time potentially curative therapy like exa-cel can bring to patients and the healthcare system. We are continuing to work with various stakeholders to ensure patients who may be eligible for exa-cel have access to this potentially curative therapy. Turning to pain.
We believe that VX-548 has the potential to play an important role across the pain spectrum, including an acute, neuropathic, and musculoskeletal pain. With the recent initiation of the VX-548 phase 3 program and the short treatment period in these trials, acute pain is now an exciting potential near-term commercial opportunity. I'll focus my remarks around three key aspects, critical to framing the acute pain market for Vertex. One, the opportunity is significant, given the market today for acute pain in the U.S.
We also remain committed to augmenting our internal research efforts with external innovation aligned with our R&D strategy. Third quarter 2022 non-GAAP operating margin was 55%. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $1.3 billion in the quarter, an increase of 11% versus the prior-year period. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2022 was 21%.
The increase reflects the strong uptake of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO in markets with recent reimbursement agreements and continued performance in the U.S. At the midpoint, the increased guidance represents full year 2022 revenue growth of approximately 17% versus 2021 and will mark Vertex's 8th consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth. There is no change to our projected 2022 combined non-GAAP R&D, acquired IP R&D, and SG&A expense range of $3 billion to $3.1 billion. There is also no change to our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance range of 21% to 22%.
Finally, a comment on movements in foreign exchange. The impact of the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro and other currencies since the start of the year is partially mitigated by our foreign exchange risk management program. For the full year 2022, at current rates, we estimate that changes in foreign exchange, net of program effects will have a negative impact of approximately 1% on our revenue growth, and this is reflected in our updated revenue guidance range for the year.
In closing, Vertex is performing exceptionally well despite the challenging macroeconomic climate. For the remainder of 2022 and into 2023, we look forward to further important milestones to mark our continued progress as highlighted on this slide. As Reshma noted, over the past year, Vertex has seen a significant acceleration in our R&D pipeline, and we are well on our way to diversifying the company and adding to our long-term growth profile. As always, we look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls.",23.0,Medium
WEC,2022,2,"Good afternoon, and welcome to WEC Energy Group's conference call for second quarter 2022 results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast. [Operator instructions] Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.
We expect to reach the top end of this new range. This, of course, assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. Our balance sheet and our cash flows remain strong. And as we've discussed, this allows us to fund a highly executable capital plan without any need for new equity.
During the quarter, we continued to move forward on major initiatives across the enterprise, including investments in our $17.7 billion ESG progress plan. Our focus remains on building and maintaining a highly reliable infrastructure, delivering energy that's affordable, reliable and clean. Scott will provide you with a project update in just a few moments. Now you may recall our recent announcement about an adjustment that we made to our schedule of power plant retirements.
We plan to extend the operating lives of the four older units at our Oak Creek site. The retirement of units five and six will be delayed by a year until May 2024. Units seven and eight will be delayed for about 18 months until late in 2025. These coal-fueled units have a total rated capacity of 1,100 megawatts.
We based this decision on two critical factors: First, tight energy supply conditions in the Midwest power market; and expected delays in the delivery of solar panels and batteries, delays that will clearly affect the in-service dates of renewable projects that are now going through the regulatory approval process in Wisconsin. Keeping the older units at Oak Creek online a bit longer for capacity purposes makes great sense for our customers because we can avoid the need to purchase higher cost capacity in the MISO market. But even with the extension of the Oak Creek units, we remain committed to our aggressive environmental goals. Across our generating fleet, we're still targeting a 60% reduction in carbon emissions by the end of 2025 and an 80% reduction by the end of 2030.
And by the end of 2030, we expect to use coal only as a backup fuel, and we're aiming for a complete exit from coal by the end of 2035. The capital investments we plan fully support this transition. Of course, for the longer term, we remain focused on the goal of net zero carbon emissions from power generation by 2050. And as you know, we're working to help shape the future of clean energy, engaging in policy discussions and on the ground, carrying out innovative projects that can drive decarbonization of the economy.
For example, we've now finalized the test plans for blending hydrogen with natural gas at one of our modern gas field units in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We've teamed up with the Electric Power Research Institute for this leading-edge project. The field work will take place this fall and the results will be shared across our industry. Separately, for our natural gas distribution business, we're making great progress in securing supplies of renewable natural gas.
On the renewable front, we've deployed $155 million toward refurbishing projects at two of our regulated wind farms. When completed, these projects will enhance reliability and performance at these farms. These investments will qualify those sites for production tax credits for an additional 10 years. Also, we expect our Red Barn Wind Park development in Southwestern Wisconsin to come online around the end of the year.
It will provide about 80 megawatts of renewable energy to our Wisconsin Public Service customers. On the solar and battery front, work continues on the Badger Hollow two solar facility and the Paris Solar Battery Park. We still expect these solar projects to go into service next year, supplying more clean energy to our Wisconsin customers. However, we've informed the Wisconsin Commission that the battery portion of the Paris project is expected to be delayed until 2024.
As you may recall, we have filed for approval of two other solar battery projects, Darien and Koshkonong. We initially plan to add these to our fleet in 2023 and 2024. We now project them to enter service in 2024 and 2025, respectively. In addition, we now expect the retirement of Columbia Energy Center to take place in 2026.
As you know, Alliant Energy operates the Columbia facility, and we are a part owner. Of course, we'll keep you updated on any further developments. As you recall, we filed a rate review last quarter with the Public Service Commission for our Wisconsin utilities. Our proposed rate increase would support important capital investments and grid hardening projects.
Recently, we provided an update to our filing. We factored in the extended operating lives of the older Oak Creek units and the Columbia units. This update also reflects other variables, including higher interest rates and costs associated with the completion of our solar projects. We expect final orders by the end of the year with new rates effective in January 2023.
We have no other rate reviews pending at this time. In our gas business, we've discussed plans to bring high-quality renewable natural gas to our customers. The Wisconsin Commission recently approved our pilot project for this initiative. Just last month, we signed our third RNG contract, which will connect our distribution system to a large dairy farm in Northeast Wisconsin.
The three contracts in place are projected to bring us 80% of the way toward our goal of net zero methane emissions. We plan to have RNG flowing in our system by the end of this year. Outside of our utilities, our WEC infrastructure segment was once again a positive driver for the quarter. The Thunderhead Wind Farm located in Nebraska will be the next project to go into service scheduled for later this year.
Scott, thank you very much. Now as you may recall, our board of directors at its January meeting raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.4%. We believe this ranks us in the top decile of our industry. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings, and therefore, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in earnings per share.
Overall, we improved on our second quarter performance by $0.04 per share compared to last year. Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $536 million. Cash earnings and a normal recovery of commodity costs contributed to this increase.
We're still analyzing the details of the proposal. From what we understand now, we believe the proposal would provide additional benefits to our customers from investments in renewables. An option to choose production tax credits for solar projects and the ability to transfer tax credits would provide more flexibility for future renewable investments. This would apply both at our utilities and at the WEC Infrastructure segment.",27.0,

XRAY,2022,1,"Before we begin, let me start with why I'm excited to be here and why I took the role as interim CEO. I joined Dentsply Sirona's board because of the value I believe the company can create for its shareholders over the near, medium and long term. First, the company plays in an attractive category with real growth opportunities. Macro trends are supportive, and those who can innovate, leverage global scale and execute judiciously will emerge as long-term winners.
Second, Dentsply Sirona has a strong foundation. The company's plan has allowed it to focus its innovation efforts, strengthen its demand generation capabilities and simplify the operating structure. Third, we are approaching the interim period with a sense of urgency and a focus on execution, and we are not coming from a standing start. Barbara and I have been working together for many years, and we have vast public company experience, where we have grown the business, while focusing on costs and pursuing disciplined capital allocation strategies.
With that opening, Q1 was a challenging quarter, which led to disappointing results. Barb will share more with you about how the key drivers of underperformance impacted the quarter's financial results, including the weaker sales performance in the U.S., global supply chain challenges and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. While we have challenges, we also have areas of the business performing quite well. Our European region delivered organic growth of 7%, and our strategic growth categories, including the implants and SureSmile business, grew high single digits and double digits, respectively.
Additionally, this quarter, we were pleased with the double-digit sequential growth of our total clear aligner business. We have updated the 2022 outlook, which further considers the significant macroeconomic headwinds that are unfolding, including impacts from prolonged supply chain challenges, COVID-related restrictions in China, Russia-Ukraine related disruptions and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. We are committed to returning cash to shareholders in Q1, and we announced a double-digit dividend increase and completed a $150 million ASR program.Lastly, an important point to highlight is that innovation is vital to our growth, and we continue to invest for future growth, despite the challenging macroeconomic environment. Moving now to Slide 6.
As I mentioned, Q1 was a challenging quarter with revenue of $965 million, which represents a decline of 1.4% on an organic basis versus the prior year. Our operating margin was 15.9%. The rate was impacted by lower manufacturing volumes and inflationary pressures, while SG&A and R&D investments were maintained to support innovation and the expected volume recovery. Before I turn the call over to Barb to provide more details on our financial performance, I would like to address the Form 12b-25 we filed with the SEC this morning.
Please refer to the reconciliation tables at the back of the press release and slides, both of which are posted in the Investors section of our website. Before I begin, I would like to note how excited I am to join the company in an interim capacity. I've worked with John over the past three years as a public company CFO, and I am now looking forward to working with the rest of the team at Dentsply Sirona as we execute against the many opportunities that are ahead of us. In the first quarter, the business delivered revenue of $965 million, in line with the preliminary results we announced on April 19.
In comparison to prior year, organic sales declined by 1.4%, and reported sales declined by 6.1%. The decline versus last year was driven by foreign exchange, U.S. regional performance, increasing challenges in our global supply chain and emerging COVID-related softness in China. Regions outside of the U.S.
posted healthy growth in the period, along with the global implants and SureSmile businesses. While we continued to experience supply chain constraints, most notably in imaging, the demand for these products remains strong as evidenced by our high order backlog. Also as a reminder, Q1 2021 was a period where the dental industry was continuing to replenish in certain categories from COVID, particularly in consumables, providing a difficult year-over-year comparison. Similarly, our Byte business was up against tough year-over-year comps.
That said, we are pleased with the sequential growth that Byte posted in the quarter. To highlight underlying momentum, Byte unique visitor traffic hit a record high in March. Gross profit was $547 million or 56.7% of sales. Gross margin rate declined 280 basis points year over year due to foreign exchange, unfavorable mix and volumes and inflationary pressure on materials and distribution costs.
These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from recently launched products and price increases. SG&A expenses were $349 million or 36.2% of sales. On an absolute basis, SG&A decreased by 1%. R&D spend was $45 million, an increase of 11.1% year over year, which reflects our continued commitment and focus on accelerating our innovation pipeline.
As a reminder, last quarter, we've reclassified certain expenses from SG&A to R&D. This had no impact on operating margin, and the prior-year period adjustment was $3 million. Operating income was $153 million, down 30% versus last year. This was due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates, U.S.
performance, supply chain pressures and increased investments in R&D. As a result, operating margin was 15.9%. We attribute approximately 60% of the year-over-year decline to the transitory macro challenges of foreign exchange, inflationary pressures and the impact of COVID in China. As a result, adjusted earnings per share was $0.52 versus $0.72 in the prior-year quarter.
Operating cash flow was $93 million, a 90% increase year over year, mostly to fluctuations in working capital. The company has a strong balance sheet and finished the quarter with $374 million in cash on hand. During the quarter, we returned $174 million to shareholders in the form of increased dividends and $150 million of share repurchases. Now turning to the segment performance in the quarter.
Ortho slightly decreased year over year as the anticipated decline in Byte given the tough comps year-over-year offset growth in SureSmile. As I mentioned previously, we are pleased with the momentum we are seeing in the clear aligner sequentially. The E&I business posted growth, despite supply chain constraints, which primarily continued to impact sales of 3D imaging equipment. The consumables segment organic sales decline was driven by lower sales in the U.S., patient volume softness attributed to COVID in certain markets, most notably in China, and supply chain constraints.
Endo, a strategic growth area, posted growth in the quarter across all regions, and we are pleased with the progress from recent product launches. The sales decline was partly offset by benefit from price increases taken in the fourth quarter of 2021. Now turning to financial performance by region during the first quarter. U.S.
sales were $299 million. Organic sales declined by 13.5% due to the lower sales in CAD/CAM and certain consumables, supply chain constraints and tough year-over-year comps, primarily in consumables and Byte. Dealer sales were lower due to higher CAD/CAM inventory levels at the start of the quarter. Implants and Endo both posted growth in the region.
The dental market remains attractive and resilient, despite pandemic variant outbreaks, which continue to challenge certain markets. Additionally, our robust R&D platform and pipeline are enhancing our commercial solutions to meet the most pressing needs of our end customers and channel partners. As we navigate a difficult external environment, we continue to focus on opportunities to sustain and drive expansion of margin. While we expect to see some period-to-period fluctuations, we estimate that for the full year, operating margin rate will be greater than 17%.
And therefore, the continuation of major disruption in the market is a notable headwind. Additionally, we are closely monitoring this disruption's potential impact on our global supply chain. Our commercial and supply chain teams are working diligently to effectively navigate and minimize the impact to our business and customers. Another regional challenge is the disruption from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which was not considered in our original outlook.
Our revised outlook has been risk-adjusted, removing all sales to Ukraine for the remainder of the year and reducing sales to Russia in compliance with known sanctions. The risk adjustment represents a modest headwind for the total company. On the supply chain, material shortages and inflationary pressures also represent significant headwinds, which we now expect to continue through the rest of the year. The component shortages impacting several parts of our business, most notably 3D imaging, have been significant.
However, we are encouraged by the continuation of strong customer -- end customer demand globally. Lastly, we have revised our foreign exchange assumptions based on the weakening euro, which represents a larger headwind for us versus the original outlook. Our updated assumption for the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate for the full year is $1.08, which is lower than our previous assumption of $1.14 and the fiscal year 2021 average of $1.19.
These improvements will be partially offset with softer commercial volumes in China and Ukraine. The back half of the year will further benefit from the momentum we are seeing in strategic parts of the business and the opportunities we can capitalize on through strong execution, including new product launches. Additionally, we continue to project that our clear aligners business will grow sequentially, and Byte will be a contributor to 2022 growth. As a reminder, in Q2, Byte will continue to face tough comps to the strong pandemic driven performance in the first half of 2021.
Nonetheless, it is highly additive to our overall clear aligner strategy, and we are seeing the merits of the transaction come through. In closing, we are optimistic that despite a challenging environment, the renewed focus we are now applying will benefit the trajectory of the company. Over the long term, we believe that improved execution, combined with the resilience of the dental market, will allow us to continue to expand revenue and earnings. Additionally, the strength of our EBITDA generation enables a very competitive cash flow yield to our shareholders.
Thank you, Barb. Moving on, I wanted to provide some perspective on our strategy and priorities moving forward. First, we have a robust portfolio of leading products and solutions in a strong end market that gives us confidence in our future. The long-term strategy of the company is compelling with a healthy innovation pipeline that is positioned to deliver growth.
I believe in it, and so does our board. This strategy is one of the key aspects that attracted me to this organization as I was considering joining the board. The Dentsply Sirona team has continued to sharpen the strategy over time, while improving innovation capabilities which, combined with a renewed focus on execution, will create powerful momentum going forward. I would like to highlight that the expectations we have for the business don't change.
We expect to build on our capabilities to deliver over the long term, specifically, reliable 4% to 5% top line growth, continuous improvement in margins and, ultimately, double-digit earnings growth once we cycle past the acute challenges we are currently facing. Our strategy of delivering superior integrated workflows and critical procedures will allow this company to become the vital digital partner to the dentist. I'm not new to digital transformation. We were on a similar journey at Hill-Rom, and I plan to draw upon those experiences as I work closely with the team here to accelerate the transformation with relentless focus on driving improved outcomes for our customers.
Barb and I are a proven team with a demonstrated track record of driving long-term shareholder value, while executing with rigor across a broad portfolio in a very challenging macro environment that we have all been witnessing in the past few years. The challenges we see at Dentsply Sirona have a high degree of correlation to challenges that we have both successfully navigated in the past. Importantly, we are both committed to delivering sequential financial improvement on the preliminary Q1 results, as we take the reins of leadership at the company. While we believe in the company's strategy, we also believe there is value in conducting an evaluation of our operational performance to ensure that we are laser focused on our key priorities moving forward.
Through integrated workflows, we can widen our share of wallet, become the essential partner and provide significant value to our customers. Let me highlight a few closing comments. We are encouraged by the good momentum we have in strategic growth areas of the business, like implants and clear aligners. We are also very pleased with the performance in our international markets in such a challenging environment as further evidence that our strategy is working.
Our focus going forward will be on driving disciplined and robust execution to capitalize on the momentum. As we exit this quarter, we remain confident that the portfolio is well positioned in an attractive market to drive sustainable growth over the long term, and that will continue to be our top priority. In my first few weeks, I have seen a very engaged, mission-driven and passionate organization that is ready to embrace a clear set of priorities to address our supply chain challenges, U.S. performance and deliver strong new product growth.
This is a renewed sense of confidence that we will build upon as we move through the remainder of the year. The revised 2022 outlook now reflects known macro challenges. We are confident in the strength of the underlying business, and we will move expeditiously to complete our diagnostic analysis, so that we can accelerate progress against a compelling strategy with a focus on execution. With this, we are optimistic about the sequential improvement we expect to see throughout 2022.
We will not be shy in taking swift action where we see improvement opportunities, and we intend to use the interim period to strengthen the base and do the hard work required to drive value creation for our shareholders. Finally, we look ahead with optimism. The Dentsply Sirona team is strong and resilient. I am confident that together we can overcome near-term challenges to deliver improvements and drive sustainable results.",16.0,Negligible
XYL,2022,2,"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Xylem's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With me today are Chief Executive Officer Patrick Decker and Chief Financial Officer Sandy Rowland. They will provide their perspective on Xylem's second quarter 2022 results and discuss the third quarter and full-year outlook. Following our prepared remarks, we'll address questions related to the information covered on the call.
Additionally, the call will be available for playback via the Investors section of our website under the heading Investor Events. Please turn to Slide 2. We will make some forward-looking statements on today's call, including references to future events or developments that we anticipate will or may occur in the future. These statements are subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as those factors described in Xylem's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.
And non-GAAP financials have been reconciled for you and are also included at the appendix section of the presentation. Now please turn to Slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker. 
Thanks, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report that the team delivered a very strong second-quarter performance on all key metrics and well ahead of our guidance. But the result builds on the momentum and underlying demand we saw in the first quarter with disciplined operational execution on strong fundamentals and a moderate easing in chip supply constraints. Revenues grew 6% organically, surpassing our guide.
The team's commercial performance was outstanding in all segments, and supply improvements in M&CS and water infrastructure enabled increased conversion of orders into revenue. Geographically, the growth was broad based. Western Europe was up 9%, North America, 6%, and emerging markets, excluding China, was up double digits. While China was down due to COVID lockdowns, backlogs continue to grow on underlying demand.
In addition to organic revenue growth, the team posted 6% orders growth. That orders momentum reflects strong performance across each segment. Water infrastructure set the strongest base growing orders of 21% in the quarter. Our backlogs are up sharply versus last year, with digital solutions comprising more than half the total backlog.
EBITDA margin also came in well ahead our guidance, we delivered strong quarter-on-quarter expansion driven by disciplined execution. All of that good work delivered earnings per share of $0.66, which soundly beat our expectations. As you can see, some incremental improvement in chip supply came earlier than anticipated and it had a strong positive impact on the quarter. To be clear, we don't believe chip supply will improve much more quickly than previously expected.
And our U.S. wastewater utility business grew double digits as supply chain constraints improved throughout the quarter. Geographically, the U.S. and Western Europe were also up double digits, driven by robust transport demand in the U.S.
Emerging markets was up low single digits, driven by strong industrial demand. Orders were up 2% organically and continue to outpace revenue with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 for the quarter. Segment EBITDA margin declined 130 basis points compared to the prior year. And while price realizations more than offset inflation, volume and mix for the quarter were negative.
Underlying demand for our AMI offering remained strong and orders continued to outpace revenue. We recorded a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4 and has built a backlog of over $2 billion. Segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was ahead of expectations, expanding 120 basis points sequentially on improved volumes. As supply chain stability improves and we convert our backlog, we will see strong margin accretion on higher volumes as we have previously discussed.
And now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and our balance sheet. In the second quarter, we generated free cash flow of $67 million, driven by income conversion, partially offset by higher working capital. Our financial position remains strong with 1.1 billion in cash and 1.9 billion of available liquidity. Net debt to EBITDA leverage is 1.5 times.
Thanks, Sandy. As you've seen, the team is delivering strong results in a very dynamic environment. Given the prominence of discussions about macro uncertainty in the economy, it's worth spending a few minutes talking about our confidence in the resilience of underlying demand for Xylem's offerings. The aspect of our sector and our business model that gets most discussed in this context and for good reason, is that our offering is at the core of essential services through the ups and downs of economic cycles.
Cities and towns must provide essential water and wastewater services, so the demand associated with water management tends to be quite resilient. It's also important to understand the dynamics between opex versus capex across economic cycles, particularly for water utilities. Opex spending is very stable given the basic need for day-to-day water services. Capex, which represents roughly a third of spending on Xylem's offerings, is focused on infrastructure expansion or refurbishment, and it comes with longer regulatory and funding approvals.
So spending against these projects once approved historically has not wavered to a material extent. And this is not just a U.S. dynamic, but it applies globally. You see it in Europe, both at the regional level.
For example, with the EU's recovery and resilience funding at the country level seen in the UK's end process. Similarly, infrastructure funding is embedded in China's five-year planning cycle. And of course, you're all familiar with the recent U.S. [Inaudible] infrastructure funding and the timelines on which the state revolving funds would work.
Our distinctive data and communications-driven AMI solutions deliver a step change in both efficiency and resilience for utilities. AMI represents now roughly a third of all water meters in the U.S., which shows the progress of adoption but also the potential for future growth. Given the budgetary pressures that utilities face, both to generate revenue and reduce water loss, smart meters will remain a top imperative. One other demand trend that will persist in the cycle and in fact is set to increase is the growing response to climate change.
Cities around the world are committing to net-zero emissions. At the same time, they are investing in mitigating the impacts of climate change that are already here like those we've seen this summer in the form of historic and tragic flooding in the U.S. and Asia. These are generational challenges.
Innovations and new approaches are absolutely essential to solving them. Because water management is a significant carbon contributor, accounting for up to 10% of greenhouse gas emissions globally. In commercial and residential markets, cities have begun introducing building regulations to reduce emissions, including efficient water management standards for both regional construction and retrofits. And utility market, which produces greenhouse gas emissions equal to the entire global shipping industry, it's going to be required to reduce its carbon intensity in line with the commitments of their cities, municipalities, and countries.
Thanks, Patrick. Consistent with our previous presentations, we've provided key facts for each market in the appendix. The outlook across our end markets has broadly improved. We expect healthy underlying demand will continue through the remainder of the year with improved price cost mix and modest improvements in supply chain.
We now expect our utility business to grow mid-single digits, up from low single digits. On the wastewater side, we now expect mid-single digit growth up from low to mid-single digit growth and improved backlog conversion and resilient global demand. The outlook for longer-term capital projects spending and bid activity remains solid globally. For clean water utilities, we now expect mid-single digit growth up from flat.
The main driver is earlier-than-expected easing of chip supply constraints. Although supply has improved, lead times continue to remain elevated and our volumes continue to be constrained. We also expect momentum in our test and pipeline assessment services business to continue due to increasing focus in our end markets on infrastructure and climate challenges as evidenced by our strong backlog. Please turn to Slide 11.
Looking at the industrial end market, we now expect high single digit to low double-digit growth, up from mid-single digit growth and increased activity in the U.S. in Europe and strong global demand for our solutions. We continue to expect the commercial end market to deliver mid-single to high single-digit growth on solid replacement activity and new product introductions in the U.S. and Europe.
We now expect full-year organic revenue growth of 8% to 10%, up from 4% to 6%, and we've raised the bottom end of our EPS range by $0.10. The increase in the reported revenue guidance is more modest as a strengthening dollar offsets roughly half of our operational improvements. We have modified our assumptions on our basket of currency exposure, which is included in the appendix. These changes result in an incremental $0.05 headwind to the full-year EPS guide, and this is on top of the $0.10 EPS FX headwind that we discussed last quarter.
On Slide 13, we've shown how our guidance breaks down by segment. We now expect high single-digit growth in water infrastructure, up from mid-single digits and low double-digit growth in applied water, up from high single digits, driven by disciplined commercial execution and backlog conversion on continuing strong demand in both segments. We now expect measurement and control solutions to be up mid-single digits up from flat. This reflects the outperformance in the first half from chip supply improving sooner than expected.
For 2022, we are raising the bottom end of our adjusted EBIT margin range, which is now 16.5% to 17%. And this yields the adjusted EPS range of $2.50 to $2.70 that I just mentioned. We now expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 90% of net income. We're caring about a month of extra inventory to mitigate the risk of supply chain disruptions and provide continuity of service to our customers.
We expect to bring conversion back to historical levels as supply chain stabilizes, enabling us to return to free cash flow conversion of at least 100%. We're providing the number of other full-year assumptions on the slide to supplement your models. And now drilling down on the third quarter, we anticipate total company organic revenues will be up 10% to 12%. This includes mid-single-digit growth in water infrastructure and mid-double-digit growth in applied water and M&CS.
In the context of short-term uncertainty, our job is to manage through the unexpected. Meeting those challenges is what being a good operator is all about, and the team has certainly been doing that. The team's strong operational execution is built on the same foundation as our 2025 Growth and Strategic Milestones, a consistent story at the heart of our investment thesis. We're building on our leadership position as a technology company with a durable business model.
We're benefiting from long-term secular trends of rising demand driven by water and climate-related challenges. We're driving above-market growth and margin expansion as we digitize our portfolio to serve our customers' imperative to be more efficient. We're successfully putting sustainability at the center of everything we do across our company, our customers, and our communities, and we'll create additional stakeholder value with disciplined capital allocation as opportunities warrant. Strong continued demand and the kind of performance we're seeing from the Xylem team show our ability to deliver on that thesis.",16.0,Negligible
XYL,2022,2,"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Xylem's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With me today are Chief Executive Officer Patrick Decker and Chief Financial Officer Sandy Rowland. They will provide their perspective on Xylem's second quarter 2022 results and discuss the third quarter and full-year outlook. Following our prepared remarks, we'll address questions related to the information covered on the call.
Additionally, the call will be available for playback via the Investors section of our website under the heading Investor Events. Please turn to Slide 2. We will make some forward-looking statements on today's call, including references to future events or developments that we anticipate will or may occur in the future. These statements are subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as those factors described in Xylem's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.
And non-GAAP financials have been reconciled for you and are also included at the appendix section of the presentation. Now please turn to Slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker. 
Thanks, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report that the team delivered a very strong second-quarter performance on all key metrics and well ahead of our guidance. But the result builds on the momentum and underlying demand we saw in the first quarter with disciplined operational execution on strong fundamentals and a moderate easing in chip supply constraints. Revenues grew 6% organically, surpassing our guide.
The team's commercial performance was outstanding in all segments, and supply improvements in M&CS and water infrastructure enabled increased conversion of orders into revenue. Geographically, the growth was broad based. Western Europe was up 9%, North America, 6%, and emerging markets, excluding China, was up double digits. While China was down due to COVID lockdowns, backlogs continue to grow on underlying demand.
In addition to organic revenue growth, the team posted 6% orders growth. That orders momentum reflects strong performance across each segment. Water infrastructure set the strongest base growing orders of 21% in the quarter. Our backlogs are up sharply versus last year, with digital solutions comprising more than half the total backlog.
EBITDA margin also came in well ahead our guidance, we delivered strong quarter-on-quarter expansion driven by disciplined execution. All of that good work delivered earnings per share of $0.66, which soundly beat our expectations. As you can see, some incremental improvement in chip supply came earlier than anticipated and it had a strong positive impact on the quarter. To be clear, we don't believe chip supply will improve much more quickly than previously expected.
And our U.S. wastewater utility business grew double digits as supply chain constraints improved throughout the quarter. Geographically, the U.S. and Western Europe were also up double digits, driven by robust transport demand in the U.S.
